# JW Startup
- I am developing the codebase for a preseed startup under Jeff Wilson being submitted to YC's W24 batch

### To Do:
- [x] Scrape data online using google search results
- [ ] Clean up data and select additional prompts for scraping and searching
- [ ] Develop solution to bypass blockers and surpass limits placed by websites like NY Times
- [ ] Develop LLM based solution to auto scrape data for use in llama index (Perplexity esque clone for multiple searches)
- [ ] Develop initial prototype in llama index using ada embeddings model
- [ ] Switch to better embeddings model to improve quality of output
- [ ] Scrape data from video content on youtube and segment based on Jeff's voice and use data to create more authentic representations of his speaking style

### Later:
- [ ] Use knowledge graph based method of using RAG to pull data contextually related to Jeff Wilson
- [ ] Collect data on chats and logs to pull data 
- [ ] Switch to running on Groq for faster inference (using API)
- [ ] Store data on S3 instead of storing locally or on git repo due to large file sizes
- [ ] Use tortoise tts for voice clone of Jeff
