It sure beat meeting for coffee\nBy CLARA BENSEN\nPUBLISHED NOVEMBER 12, 2013 12:00AM (EST)\nFacebook\n169\nTwitter\nReddit\n25\nEmail\n2\nsave\nWe\u2019re standing on the side of a highway in Budapest, trying to hitch a ride. I\u2019m elegantly dressed for a proper afternoon at the National Gallery in a green embroidered dress and a knotted cotton scarf. Jeff appears to have just walked off the set of a western shot in Brooklyn. His grandfather\u2019s 1950s Stetson, cocked lazily to the side, is accompanied by a pair of fiery red chinos and a striped navy sweater. Both ensembles are looking a little threadbare and with good reason: We\u2019ve worn them every day since we left the Houston airport nearly three weeks ago.\nThis is not your average OkCupid date.\n\u201cShould we start walking?\u201d asks Jeff. Hungarian drivers are passing us by with expressions of bewilderment, and we\u2019re determined to get to Sarajevo by nightfall. So, after an hour of no takers, we decide to test the gods by beginning the 350-mile journey on foot. We make it about 10 steps before a Good Samaritan in a rusty red Peugeot takes mercy on us and pulls off the highway.\nAdvertisement:\nHe plays a game of Tetris with the 15 strawberry crates in his trunk, eventually resulting in two narrow canyons of space, just big enough for our bodies. He waves to us and we gratefully wedge ourselves in, only to find him looking at us with a furrowed brow. He appears to be hosting an internal wrestling match with the English lexicon. Finally, he finds the words, \u201cWhere are bags!\u201d\nThis is Jeff\u2019s favorite question and his reply is delivered with practiced flair. \u201cYou ever met anyone traveling with no stuff?\u201d\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"580\" caption=\"Budapest, Hungary\"][/caption]\nAdvertisement:\nMy grasp on good, old-fashioned reality is not terribly robust. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to wake up inside a Salvador Dal\u00ed painting or an interplanetary episode of \"Doctor Who.\" Yet, despite my surrealist leanings, even I was a bit startled to find myself hurtling toward the Croatian border with no bags, no change of clothes and no clue what was going to happen next. What bizarre chain of events had led to this scenario?\nIn some ways I blame Jeff. The warning indicators were flashing red-alert red from the moment I saw the oversize Mexican mariachi bow tie in his OkCupid profile picture three months ago. This guy was trouble of the best variety.\nOn the surface, we appeared to be sure candidates for \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Unlikely Pair.\u201d He\u2019s a wildly energetic university professor who is always on the move. I\u2019m a reclusive writer who spends hours identifying new constellations in the ceiling paint. He can strike an insta-friendship with any human not in a coma. I often pretend I don\u2019t recognize people at the grocery store. Somehow our personality differences are offset by the fact that the same mad scientist blood flows through both of our veins. We live for the unexpected, the experimental and the subtly disruptive.\nAdvertisement:\nNever one to waste time, Jeff set an experimental trap weeks before he knew my real last name or whether I actually looked like the pictures in my OkCupid account. His third email was coy: \u201cDo you have any ideas for travel experiments? I have a few things I dabble in, and I\u2019m going to push one of these experiments to the nth limit in June.\u201d\n\u201cDabbling\u201d referred to his traditional method of travel, which involved booking an outbound flight to one international airport and an inbound flight out of some other port-of-calling a few countries away. Beyond visas and flight details his trips were completely unstructured. No hotels and no itineraries.\nOh yeah, and the newest nth limit twist: no stuff.\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"580\" caption=\"Dubrovnik, Croatia\"][/caption]\nAdvertisement:\nNo stuff? As far as habits go, I\u2019m a pretty standard American woman. I shower regularly, I like clean clothes, and it\u2019s a rare occasion where you can find me looking disheveled. I\u2019m not gonna lie: The thought of ultra-minimalist travel was initially disturbing. I imagined myself stumbling through Byzantine masterpieces with greasy hair and a foul, beer-stained dress equipped with the power to repel all tourists in a 10-foot radius. Hell no. And yet, the idea of moving completely unencumbered through space and time was tantalizing. Even nightmares of unkempt leg hair couldn\u2019t completely banish the thought. What would it be like to say no to heavy backpacks full of coordinating outfits, Lonely Planet travel guides, and cheap souvenirs? What would happen if I navigated all of my needs in real time?\nIn the end, I succumbed to curiosity and signed my name to the no-carry-on dotted line. I was in. Exactly one month and two weeks after meeting online, Jeff and I nervously booked two luggage-free flights to Istanbul. This was either the best idea ever or the beginning of a brutal, three-week long demise. As Mark Twain so aptly put it, \u201cThere ain\u2019t no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them.\u201d\nAdvertisement:\n\u201cWhat will you wear when you\u2019re washing your clothes?\u201d The flight attendant\u2019s concern cycled through my head on repeat as we touched down in Atat\u00fcrk Airport. She had whispered it dubiously, like a disapproving mother. The truth was, I had no idea what I would wear when I was washing my clothes. I didn\u2019t even have soap, let alone a modesty backup.\nThe night before we left Jeff and I had painstakingly cataloged the items we deemed crucial for our 21-day journey. Passports, credit cards and iPhones made the cut, as did a small notebook, a toothbrush and a clipped map of the Balkans.  Jeff stuffed his core items in his pockets. My dress lacked adequate pocket space, so I substituted with a small shoulder purse that allowed me space for a few additional toiletries, an iPad Mini, and the awkward-looking retainer I\u2019ve been wearing since my braces came off 10 years ago.\nThat was it.\nJeff packed in 2 minutes and 31 seconds flat. I inched along at the slothly rate of 8 minutes. With a combined prep time of 10 minutes, we were off to the George Bush International airport. Jeff and I are both experienced travelers, but neither one of us was prepared for how surreal it would feel to stroll into an international terminal with no itinerary and nothing to hold on to. I swear I experienced phantom shoulder pain from past heavy-laden backpack adventures. It was liberating. It was terrifying.\nAdvertisement:\nOur no-luggage journey began with the buzzing protest energy of Istanbul and from there it zigzagged wildly across the European continent. There were no plans. With no stuff, moving to the next destination was as simple as getting out of bed and pointing to a dot on the map. We jumped from city to city using almost every mode of transportation on earth: an old train along the Turkish coast, a giant ferry across the Aegean, a cramped bus through the Balkans, a series of hitches through Croatia, a flight to Edinburgh, and a pair of bikes in London. From baristas and dancers to investment bankers and Cambridge professors, we wandered the streets with guides who were as varied as the urban landscapes we were moving through.\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"580\" caption=\"Istanbul, Turkey\"][/caption]\nAdvertisement:\nWhen tired we surfed on couches, floors, park lawns and a real bed or two. When hungry we grazed on street food, cafe fare and the occasional home-cooked meal. When curious we drifted in and out of crowded bazaars, empty churches, political protests, and ancient ruins. When washing our clothes we wore scarf togas, bed sheets, towels and borrowed T-shirts.\nAfter a few days of wearing the same dress I realized that my initial fears of dire uncleanliness were unfounded. Soap is a fairly universal concept. If I was dirty, I took a shower wherever we were staying. If my dress began to smell a little earthy, I washed it in a sink or a washing machine before I went to sleep. It was really that simple. The same thing applied to toiletries. All I needed to feel attractive and put together was deodorant, a toothbrush, and some light cosmetics.\nNeither Jeff nor I wanted an around-the-world adventure in suffering. We like to eat, sleep and travel well -- just like everyone else. Many people interpreted our experiment as a radical act (\u00e0 la John the Baptist\u2019s honey and crickets survival diet), but it truly wasn\u2019t designed to test how much deprivation we could endure. We were curious about whether we could enjoy a journey just as much -- or even more \u2014 when we eliminated the tourist agenda and most of the material trappings. What we discovered was that after a certain base level was met (water, food, shelter and a fully charged iPhone), decreasing the number of possessions did little to affect the quality of our journey. What we lost in souvenirs, we gained in unprecedented freedom of movement and an unbeatable conversation starter.\nAdvertisement:\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"580\" caption=\"Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina\"][/caption]\nIn the end, Jeff and I didn\u2019t make it to Sarajevo by nightfall. We did, however, make it by 1 a.m. Strawberry Samaritan dropped us at a rural Croatian border crossing where we walked across, papers in hand. Soon after we were picked up by a Sean Connery look-alike who informed us that he worked with wines. Wines turned out to be a mistaken translation of mines. We discovered the error when he parked his Subaru and walked us to a barbed-wire fence laced with warning signs that left no room for mistranslation.  Sobered by the minefield tour, we continued our journey south with a meditative tank driver named Igor, his name a literal remnant of the Soviet era.\nAdvertisement:\nIgor put us on a bus to Sarajevo after an approaching wall of clouds clearly signaled the end of hitchhiking. From the rainy bus window we watched the pastoral fields of Croatia abruptly shift to the unearthly, shelled-out landscape of northern Bosnia-Herzegovina. The bus, which should have been retired in the Cretaceous Age, waited until darkness had settled before repeatedly flat lining in the middle of the road. No one balked. In fact, the distinctive camaraderie of strangers emerged. Laughter rippled through the seats each time the lights flickered and the engine died. A round of cheers followed when the driver cranked it back to life. Surreptitious bottles of beer were passed from seat to seat and chocolates emerged from nowhere. I have no idea how we made it to Sarajevo, but I do know that that day embodied everything we set out to learn from our experiment.\nWe ended our journey after eight countries, 3,500 miles and 21 days in the same clothes. Our romantic relationship intact, Jeff and I boarded the Heathrow return flight as closer friends than ever (despite the questionable state of our undergarments). Materially speaking I was as empty-handed as the day we started, but I actually carried a great deal back home across the Atlantic. Traveling with no luggage and no plans was much more than a minimalist lesson in living well with less. It was an intense, in-your-face invitation to the unknown. There\u2019s a truly magnificent side to the unknown, but we aren\u2019t taught how to welcome it, let alone explore the breadth of its possibilities.\nAdvertisement:\nDid our luggage-less dance with uncertainty lead to some kind of travel nirvana? Yes and no. We careered through time and space at a fiendish pace and experienced all the blood, sweat and exhaustion that might be expected. At the same time, we were vividly present in the midst of a disorienting cloud of city grids, metro stops and incomprehensible dialects that shape-shifted with every border crossing. We were alive. And every so often the intensity was punctuated with time-crushing moments that were so staggeringly beautiful and strange that even now I\u2019m not sure they occurred at all.\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"580\" caption=\"London, England\"][/caption]\n\nBy CLARA BENSEN\nClara Bensen is a writer based in Austin, Texas currently writing a travel memoir, \"No Baggage,\" based on her many adventures with Jeff.

Couple take a 21-day trip across Europe instead of 'getting coffee'\nBy SADIE WHITELOCKS\nPUBLISHED: 18:59 BST, 12 November 2013 | UPDATED: 19:44 BST, 12 November 2013\n105\nView\ncomments\n\nA couple of online daters have told how they ditched the standard 'getting coffee' or 'grabbing a movie' in favor of a 21-day European adventure.\nFreelance writer Clara Bensen and Dr Jeff Wilson, a professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University, met via the dating site OkCupid and eight weeks later the Texas-based duo found themselves on a plane to Istanbul, Turkey.\nWriting about their whirlwind excursion, which took place in June, for Salon.com, Miss Bensen noted: 'As Mark Twain so aptly put it, \"There ain\u2019t no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them.\"\nBeats having coffee! First-time daters Clara Bensen and Dr Jeff Wilson at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, before departing on their 21-day European tour\nThe blonde told MailOnline that she had only been signed up to OkCupid for seven days before stumbling across Dr Wilson's 'intriguing and strange' profile, which showed a photo of him wearing an oversize Mexican Mariachi bow tie.\nTRENDING\nI named my daughter after a common household item and now she hates me\n5.4k viewing now\nI regret letting my husband persuade me to move to the country\n92.1k viewing now\nThese hilarious notices will leave you more confused than informed\n1.8k viewing now\nThe academic suggested going away together in the third email he sent to Miss Bensen, before knowing her real last name or if her profile photo was a true representation of what she looked like.\n'Do you have any ideas for travel experiments? I have a few things I dabble in, and I\u2019m going to push one of these experiments to the nth limit in June,' he wrote.\nPacking light: The duo - who had met a handful of times before their trip - decided to travel luggage-free - here are the few possessions they decided to take with them\nIt turned out pushing it to the 'nth limit' meant traveling 'completely unstructured' with no itinerary, no hotels booked and - to Miss Bensen's horror - no luggage.\nRecalling her reaction, she wrote on Salon.com: 'No stuff? As far as habits go, I\u2019m a pretty standard American woman. I shower regularly, I like clean clothes, and it\u2019s a rare occasion where you can find me looking disheveled.'\n'Somehow our personality differences are offset by the fact we live for the unexpected and the experimental'\nHowever, drawn to his adventurous spirit, she decided to take up the challenge and sign her name to the 'no-carry-on dotted line.'\nThe pair, who had met around a dozen times before traveling together, decided to wear the same outfits for the duration of their trip - including the same underwear - and wash-and-dry en route.\nMiss Bensen opted for a green embroidered dress - that could be adapted for various occasions -a shoulder satchel and sandals while Dr Wilson wore red chinos and a striped navy sweater.\nThe few possessions that they did pack into their pockets and purse included passports, credit cards, iPhones, maps and toothbrushes.\nIn a bid to look attractive for her beau, Miss Bensen also snuck in deodorant and some cosmetics.\nShe and Dr Wilson spent $1,200 on return flight tickets from and to Houston, Texas, with stops in Turkey and Scotland.\nFirst stop! The couple pose for a photograph in Izmir, Turkey\nNext destination: The Acropolis of Athens in Greece was a must-see for the duo\nOn average, they ended up spending around $30 a day on food and lodging.\nShe admitted before setting off she was nervous about how she and Dr Wilson would get along.\n'On the surface, we appeared to be sure candidates for \"World\u2019s Most Unlikely Pair.\" [Jeff's] a wildly energetic university professor who is always on the move. \n'I\u2019m a reclusive writer who spends hours identifying new constellations in the ceiling paint.'\n'We're compatible on multiples levels: physical, emotional, spiritual, etc. That doesn't come along every day'\nHowever, as they went along, Miss Bensen realized she had more in common with Dr Wilson than she originally thought.\n'[I discovered] somehow our personality differences are offset by the fact that the same mad scientist blood flows through both of our veins.\n'We live for the unexpected, the experimental and the subtly disruptive.'\nIn total they traveled to eight countries over the 21 days using various modes of transport including ferry, car, bicycle, and foot power.\n'There were no plans. With no stuff, moving to the next destination was as simple as getting out of bed and pointing to a dot on the map,' Miss Bensen recounted.\nTo keep costs down, she and Dr Wilson slept in hostels and small hotels for three out of the 21 nights and spent the remainder surfing on couches, floors and even park lawns.\nTaste of England: London was another point of call for the couple\nTaking the tram: A commuter takes a picture of the couple in Budapest, Hungary\nWhen hungry, they grazed on street food, cafe fare and the occasional home-cooked meal.\nMiss Bensen told MailOnline that the most memorable part of the trip was seeing iconic spaces such as the Parthenon in Greece at dawn and roaming around the ruins at Ephesus in Turkey.\nThe most challenging part, she added, was the 'lack of privacy and rest.'\nReturning to Mark Twain's quote, it turned out that Miss Bensen and Dr Wilson did 'like' each other after traveling together.\nMiss Bensen concluded, six months on: 'Jeff and I are still together and I would say that we have definitely have chemistry but it's a chemistry with a lot of depth to it.\n'We're compatible on multiples levels: physical, emotional, spiritual, etc. That kind of compatibility doesn't come along every day, and we don't take it for granted.\n'[Our trip] sure beat meeting for coffee.'\nShare or comment on this article: Craziest OkCupid date ever?

However, we will say that the inspiration for the story does sound like it has the makings of a charming romantic comedy. Variety has word that New Line Cinema is looking to adapt Clare Benson's Salon.com article \"The Craziest Ok Cupid Date Ever\" for a feature film called No Baggage that will follow two online romancers who traveled through eight countries in three weeks without changing clothes.\nAs Benson explains, the date was pretty wild and majestic:\n\u201cWith no stuff, moving to the next destination was as simple as getting out of bed and pointing to a dot on the map,\u201d she said. \u201cWe jumped from city to city using almost every mode of transportation on earth: an old train along the Turkish coast, a giant ferry across the Aegean, a cramped bus through the Balkans, a series of hitches through Croatia, a flight to Edinburgh and a pair of bikes in London.\u201d\nFor the date, no plans were made in advance. It was just two people who barely knew each other going off on a whirlwind adventure, flying by the seat of their pants. It's pretty inspiring actually, even though it's also rather dangerous. New Line is working with Adam Shankman (director Hairspray and Rock of Ages) to produce the film through his Offspring Entertainment production banner (who are also behind the spiritual Mean Girls sequel Mean Moms). We're just glad this falls outside the realm of your typical romantic comedy, at least from a story standpoint. Now a script just needs to be written.

Unless this is the story of two morons, bringing a single set of clothing doesn't mean you can't buy more clothes. Also, that cramped bus ride in the Balkans couldn't have been fun for the other riders who likely had fresh clothes on that hadn't been subjected to weeks of travel.\nMike on May 2, 2014\n4\nOkCupid?

INSIDERSHOPKARDASHIANSTV SCOOPROYALS\nThe \"Craziest OKCupid Date Ever\" Is Going to Become a Movie!\n\"Jeff and I traveled to eight countries in 21 days without changing clothes. It sure beat meeting for coffee,\" Clara Bensen wrote\nBy BRUNA NESSIF SEP 25, 2014 11:05 AMTAGS\nInstagram\nWe're sure there are plenty of fun tales from those who have dabbled in online dating, but one specific story has deemed itself worthy of a big screen feature\u2014and understandably so!\nVariety reports that New Line Cinema is moving forward with the movie adaptation of writer Clara Bensen's \"Craziest OKCupid Date Ever\" story from Salon.com nearly a year ago, where she documents a spontaneous three-week adventure with a man she met on the popular dating website OKCupid.\n\"Jeff and I traveled to eight countries in 21 days without changing clothes. It sure beat meeting for coffee,\" she wrote.\nThe film will appropriately be titled No Baggage, which is also the title of Bensen's book that will accompany the movie (due next fall).\nRELATED: OKCupid founder admits site \"doesn't really know what it's doing\"\nOn the surface, we appeared to be sure candidates for \"World's Most Unlikely Pair.\" He's a wildly energetic university professor who is always on the move. I'm a reclusive writer who spends hours identifying new constellations in the ceiling paint. He can strike an insta-friendship with any human not in a coma. I often pretend I don't recognize people at the grocery store. Somehow our personality differences are offset by the fact that the same mad scientist blood flows through both of our veins. We live for the unexpected, the experimental and the subtly disruptive.\nNever one to waste time, Jeff set an experimental trap weeks before he knew my real last name or whether I actually looked like the pictures in my OkCupid account. His third email was coy: \"Do you have any ideas for travel experiments? I have a few things I dabble in, and I'm going to push one of these experiments to the nth limit in June.\"\n\"Dabbling\" referred to his traditional method of travel, which involved booking an outbound flight to one international airport and an inbound flight out of some other port-of-calling a few countries away. Beyond visas and flight details his trips were completely unstructured. No hotels and no itineraries.\nOh yeah, and the newest nth limit twist: no stuff.\nBensen added, \"Exactly one month and two weeks after meeting online, Jeff and I nervously booked two luggage-free flights to Istanbul. This was either the best idea ever or the beginning of a brutal, three-week long demise. As Mark Twain so aptly put it, 'There ain't no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them.'\"\nSo, Clara let go of the fear that most women who online date have (that the guy is a serial killer) and Jeff didn't let his fear of whether or not Bensen looked like her pictures stop them from creating an epic date for the books big screen.\nAdam Brooks (Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Definitely, Maybe and Practical Magic) will adapt the script. New Line set the project up with Adam Shankman and Jennifer Gibgot at their Offspring Entertainment banner.\n(Oh, and judging by Clara's Instagram, she and Jeff are still together.

Now, their crazy first date is about to hit the big screen. Photo: Instagram\nCatherine Robert\nSep 27, 2014 01:00 pm\nAfter meeting online, they didn't meet for coffee or a stroll in the park.\nInstead, Clara Bensen and fellow OkCupid member Jeff Wilson decided to set off on a trip together.\nTotally crazy right? We know. It was all worth it though because the couple are still very much in love AND they're about to have a movie made about them.\nIt all started a year ago when the two found each other on dating site OKCupid.\nAfter chatting with each other for a month and the half, before Bensen and Wilson set off on a three-week adventure, travelling to eight countries together without changing their clothes.\nYuck!\nSINGAPORE\nHe has intimate scenes in K-version of Entourage\nOct 21, 2016\nRelated Stories\nMovie Review: Inferno (PG13)\nInferno actors ooze Italian style in Ferragamo\nTom Hanks: 'I don't want to disappoint Ron'\nBut that's not all that's crazy about their love story.\n  Variety reported that New Line Cinema is moving forward with the movie adaptation of writer Bensen's \"Craziest OkCupid Date Ever\" story from Salon.com which she posted at the end of last year (2013).\n\"Jeff and I traveled to eight countries in 21 days without changing clothes. It sure beat meeting for coffee,\" she wrote in her travel memoirs.\nExplaining her big leap of faith (which most women would be far too afraid to do in case the guy turned out to be some psychopath), Bensen offered a Mark Twain quote.\n  She said: \"Exactly one month and two weeks after meeting online, Jeff and I nervously booked two luggage-free flights to Istanbul.\n\"This was either the best idea ever or the beginning of a brutal, three-week long demise. As Mark Twain so aptly put it, 'There ain't no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them'.\"\nSources: E!

For her, it seemed like an incredibly bizarre risk, as this man who looked like he\u2019d just auditioned for a role in a Williamsburg production of Curious George could have been a really hip serial killer, for all she knew. For him, it seemed like a really ridiculous effort for an online dating bro to get laid. I mean, did he even try sending dick pics first? Regardless, Bensen named her adventure with Jeff \u201cThe craziest OkCupid date ever,\u201d and for once Internet commenters probably didn\u2019t complain about the hyperbole.\nNaturally, Bensen\u2019s wild adventure, which had her and Jeff traveling through eight countries over 21 days, all with only the clothes that they wore when they first met, drew the eyes of Hollywood execs who have developed romantic comedies from less. Sure enough, according to Variety, the story was optioned by New Line Cinema in April and now the studio has signed rom-com scribe and Tony Shalhoub lookalike contest runner-up Adam Brooks to bring us\u2026 get ready for it\u2026 No Baggage.\nBrooks has previously penned French Kiss, Definitely Maybe and Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, but his greatest work to date, according to me, is 2004\u2019s Wimbledon, which combined my love of underdogs, tennis tournaments, Jon Favreau playing a hapless goon and Kirsten Dunst being pushed as a romantic lead. Rom-coms don\u2019t get much more ridiculous than that. So what about No Baggage? What is Brooks getting himself into?\nWhen tired we surfed on couches, floors, park lawns and a real bed or two. When hungry we grazed on street food, cafe fare and the occasional home-cooked meal. When curious we drifted in and out of crowded bazaars, empty churches, political protests, and ancient ruins. When washing our clothes we wore scarf togas, bed sheets, towels and borrowed T-shirts.\nAfter a few days of wearing the same dress I realized that my initial fears of dire uncleanliness were unfounded. Soap is a fairly universal concept. If I was dirty, I took a shower wherever we were staying. If my dress began to smell a little earthy, I washed it in a sink or a washing machine before I went to sleep. It was really that simple. The same thing applied to toiletries. All I needed to feel attractive and put together was deodorant, a toothbrush, and some light cosmetics.\nNeither Jeff nor I wanted an around-the-world adventure in suffering. We like to eat, sleep and travel well \u2014 just like everyone else. Many people interpreted our experiment as a radical act (\u00e0 la John the Baptist\u2019s honey and crickets survival diet), but it truly wasn\u2019t designed to test how much deprivation we could endure. We were curious about whether we could enjoy a journey just as much \u2014 or even more \u2014 when we eliminated the tourist agenda and most of the material trappings. What we discovered was that after a certain base level was met (water, food, shelter and a fully charged iPhone), decreasing the number of possessions did little to affect the quality of our journey. What we lost in souvenirs, we gained in unprecedented freedom of movement and an unbeatable conversation starter. (Via Salon)\nAgain, what a remarkable story. In fact, it\u2019s so good that Bensen also got a book deal to retell the adventure that she already told, only longer. We\u2019re typically quick to dismiss most rom-coms, but I have to admit that I am really looking forward to seeing Zooey Deschanel and Miles Teller (as well as Josh Gad as their hilarious online travel agent) star in No Baggage on Valentine\u2019s Day 2016.\n[Vince\u2019s Note: I enjoy that their blind date attire included a grey beanie, some sort of Native American hoodie, and plain t-shirts.]\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFlipboard\nEmail\nuproxx.it\nTAGS: ADAM BROOKS, NEW LINE CINEMA, NO BAGGAGE, OKCUPID, ROM-COMS, ROMANTIC COMEDIES, SALON\nPrivacy Policy\nThis site is using cookies, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

The one that made your heart hurt and your brain feel strange things? Well, we've got a little more info.\nThe story Clara Bensen originally posted on Salon was mostly about her and Jeff's trip around the world, but The Expeditioner correctly guessed that we were hankering for more details on the relationship behind it all. Bensen opened up on the subject, and of course, it's every bit as whimsical as you'd expect.\nFor the record, they had met before they embarked on the trip together. This is how it happened, if you can believe it: \"The first time Jeff and I arranged to meet in person, he gave me a set of geographical coordinates and told me to meet him at exactly 7:52 p.m. The coordinates turned out to be a blue-tiled star right under the giant marble dome of the Texas State Capitol building. 7:52 p.m. was sunset. The word \u201csubtle\u201d has never been in his vocabulary.\"\nSeriously, someone needs to make this into a movie right now. Immediately. We might just close down operations at R29 and turn the place into a movie studio just for this \u2014 that's how intensely rom-com-able it is. Of course, that's not all there is to it. While she admits that the draw to the story was largely the OkCupid hook, for Bensen, the reasoning behind their adventure was really to explore their relationship with material possessions. \"Some commenters have pointed out that millions of people in the world live with very few belongings and it was no big achievement for us to have gone luggage-less for a few weeks. That is a completely valid point and we wouldn\u2019t deny it,\" she explains. \"Still, as an American living in a culture that places a high value on consumption and accumulating stuff, it felt personally meaningful to explore my dependency on physical belongings within the context of travel.\" No kidding. As the saying goes, it's a lot easier to form a habit than it is to break one, and luxuriating in piles of mostly useless stuff is something many of us are all too guilty of.\nThis interview is every bit as worth reading as the original article, so please, do check it out. Oh, and in case you're wondering what happened to that green dress? \"I haven\u2019t worn the green dress since the last day of the experiment. It\u2019s hanging in my closet as the only souvenir I brought back from the trip.\" (The Expeditioner)\nCLARA BENSEN OKCUPID DATE TRIP ADVENTURE 2013\nSEX \u2022 WELLNESS\nMore from Sex & Relationships\nSOMOS LATINX\nWhy First-Gen Latines Often Have An Insecure Attachment Style\nNICOLE FROIO\nAUG 1, 2024\nSEX TOYS\nThe 25 Best Oral Sex Toys, According To Reviewers\nby KASANDRA BRABAW\nSEX TOYS\n24 Whisper-Quiet Vibrators For Masturbating In Silent Mode\nby CHARLOTTE LEWIS\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nTHIRST WEEK\nForget \u201cIcks,\u201d Here Are Our Oddly Specific Turn-Ons\nby KATHLEEN NEWMAN-B...\nSEX TOYS\nThe Best Clitoral Vibrators, According To A Sex Therapist\nby KARINA HOSHIKAWA\nMOST WANTED\nBroke But Horny?

Davis, features writer for New York Magazine and the Cut. \nPhoto: Clara Bensen/Instagram\nWhat happens when \u201ca reclusive writer who spends hours identifying new constellations in the ceiling paint\u201d agrees to go on an OKCupid date with \u201ca wildly energetic university professor\u201d? Well, if they\u2019re two twentysomethings who share an overly robust sense of whimsy, the date turns into a spontaneous three-week trip around the world, which turns into a Salon essay and then into a big-time Hollywood movie.\nVariety reports that Clara Bensen\u2019s essay \u201cThe Craziest OkCupid Date Ever\u201d is being adapted into a rom-com called No Baggage. The movie sounds like the final nail in the genre\u2019s coffin, but at the very least this means our crappy OKCupid dates have the potential to become something more than a pile of misery.\n\nHey, Hollywood: My craziest OKCupid date was when the guy said he was five foot eight but turned out to be five foot two. I left after two-thirds of a drink and went home and ate a pint of ice cream even though I\u2019m lactose intolerant.

These strangers' whirlwind tour of Europe wasn't your standard dinner-and-movie date.\nSTAFF WRITERS\nless than 2 min read\nNovember 14, 2013 - 2:13PM\nNewsComAu\nJeff and Clara during their travels. Picture: Supplied\nRelationships\nDon't miss out on the headlines from Relationships. Followed categories will be added to My News.\nFollow\nWOULD you travel around the world with someone you had just met, and with no possessions but the clothes on your back?\nThat's what Clara Bensen did.\nThe young American writer met Jeff, a university professor, three months ago via the online dating website OkCupid, she reveals in an op-ed piece on Salon.\nBut as they got chatting online, Jeff revealed his fondness for travel and invited Clara on his next trip. Though he's not your average holiday-maker.\nJeff would book an outgoing flight overseas and a flight back home out of another city a few countries away - without an itinerary or any plans to speak of. And his latest experiment? Bringing nothing but the clothes on his back.\nClara was initially sceptical. \"I'm not gonna lie: The thought of ultra-minimalist travel was initially disturbing\".\nBut she couldn't help but feel intrigued by the idea.\n\"Even nightmares of unkempt leg hair couldn't completely banish the thought. What would it be like to say no to heavy backpacks full of coordinating outfits, Lonely Planet travel guides, and cheap souvenirs?\".\nAnd so six weeks after meeting, the pair nervously booked two flights (luggage not included) to Istanbul.\nIn Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Picture: Supplied\nThe few items they did take included: passports, credit cards, iPhones, a small notebook, a toothbrush, a map, an iPad mini and some toiletries.\nClara and Jeff with all their \"luggage\" laid out. Picture: Supplied\nTheir journey began in Istanbul and from there they zigzagged wildly across Europe. The pair travelled city to city, via whatever means they came across.\n\"There were no plans. With no stuff, moving to the next destination was as simple as getting out of bed and pointing to a dot on the map,\" she wrote on Salon.\nIn London. Picture: Supplied\nClara and Jeff made their way surfing on couches, eating street food and visiting tourist hot spots. And they managed to find a way around the whole one-outfit issue.\n\"After a few days of wearing the same dress I realised that my initial fears of dire uncleanliness were unfounded. Soap is a fairly universal concept,\" she wrote.\nIn Dubrovnik, Croatia.

Wilson lived in the dumpster over the course of the yearlong project.[4]\nJupe[edit]\nIn 2020, Wilson launched Jupe, a flat-packed housing tech startup.[5]\nKasita[edit]\nKasita Exterior\nWilson was a Co-Founder and CEO at the startup company Kasita.[6][2][7] Kasita builds micro smart homes that are capable of stacking.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Kasita was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies[14] and won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award.[15] Wilson has referred to Kasita as a holistic integrated product, rather than a house.[16] In December 2018, Kasita was sold to a tiny house hotel company[17] in Austin, Texas.\nThe Dumpster Project[edit]\nProfessor Dumpster in front of a dumpster\nWilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)(3) non-profit 'The Dumpster Project',[18] a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home.[19] The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant[26] and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition,[27] but a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal.[28] The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \"poverty tourism\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity.[29] On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'.[30] Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators.[31][32] On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster.[4][33] Wilson claims that the dumpster experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita.[6]\n\"No Baggage\" experiment[edit]\nWilson and Bensen in No Baggage\nTogether with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' \"No Baggage\", in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website.[34][35][36] New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones [37] to screen write the film based on a book[38] from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen.[39][40][41][42] American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film.[43]\n99 Nights Couchsurfing experiment[edit]\nSubsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces.[4][44] The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.[45]\nAcademic Work[edit]\nWilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston\u2013Tillotson University in Austin, Texas.[1] He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury[46] and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States.[47] Wilson has authored numerous publications in the environmental science field and has received funding from the National Science Foundation.[48]\nReferences[edit]\n^\na b Wilson, Jeff. \"Jeff Wilson, Huston Tillotson\".

For Wilson, who is known for his out-of-the-box companies and sustainability experiments (He founded award-winning modular housing company, Kasita, and once lived in a dumpster as a minimalist housing study) creating unique, mind-bending solutions is something he can\u2019t resist. So, it\u2019s no wonder that his latest innovation not only blends eco-friendly design with techy additions but proposes an aesthetic alternative to its function-first predecessor.\nThe Jupe team, which includes former Tesla and SpaceX designers and engineers, aims to create spaces with packetized infrastructure that are light on the land. Jupe\u2019s latest launch, The Portal, is a state-of-the-art portable toilet, a fully off-grid and packable structure that can be used for events, festivals, camping, and more, is a logical next step to its popular sleeping unit. Furthermore, The Portal can be set up anywhere porta-potties are allowed without the hassle of permitting.\nJupe founder Jeff Wilson stands next to the Portal in a redwood forest. COURTESY JUPE\nDrawing inspiration from 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, as well as the impressive, austere works of Donald Judd and James Turrell, the space-age Portal features a renewable Douglas Fir frame with mirrored exterior wrapping, solar power, an always-on fan, skylight, and three times the interior space of a traditional outdoor toilet. Wilson and his team even went to Burning Man for direct user feedback, taking complaints of the dark, knee-bumping experience and left vowing to do better. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the smell,\u201d Wilson explains. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to turn around, manipulate clothing off and on, or even stand up.\u201d\nIn lieu of the cramped experience, the Jupe designers wanted heeding the call of Mother Nature to be a radically different experience. \u201cAspirational and porta-potty aren\u2019t two words you\u2019d ever expect to hear in the same sentence,\u201d the company\u2019s founder remarks.\nCOURTESY JUPE\nWhile the first Portals are currently in production and readying to ship, a tester unit in the redwood forests an 80-minute drive north of Santa Cruz, California, has made quite the unexpected impact. \u201cPeople are unsure what it is,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cIs it a time machine, spaceship, or a weird monolith? No one guessed there was a toilet in there. There\u2019s nothing in the world that looks anything like it.\u201d Users step inside to welcoming LED track lighting, two-way glass, a pull-down screen, crisp interior, and canopy views. The Portal offers a design-forward alternative to rows of plastic toilets at concerts, parks, and campgrounds, but Wilson wants to take things a step further, pairing the Portal with his company\u2019s tiny home business to offer a complete kit for off-grid living.\nMORE FROM METROPOLIS\n\u2018We\u2019re working with Wasted*, a Vermont-based sanitation company, as our composting partner and will be integrating their proprietary circular-waste transformation technology, so what is produced will be returned to the Earth safely as fertilizer,\u201d he says. Wilson expects the Earth Portal, a version with built in composting tech, to be available for purchase by end-of-year. it could be a game-changer for off-gridders looking to step up their sustainability game.\nPrev\nNext\nCOURTESY JUPE\nWould you like to comment on this article?

It's Tuesday, March 7th - Today, we're covering a glamping business set to make $12M in revenue this year and Amazon's wildly profitable $40B advertising business.\n- Callum\nFEATURE\nThis Is A $12M/yr Glamping Business\nIn 2020, Jeff Wilson founded Jupe with the mission of solving the global housing crisis and this year his company is set to do $12 million in revenue.\nWilson is an eccentric guy\u2013 He\u2019s an ex-IBM manager, a former professor of environmental science, and he lived in a dumpster for a year.\nSo, let\u2019s figure out how he pulled off Jupe\u2019s success.\nSo What\u2019s the Business?\nWilson sells and rents Jupes, tent-like tiny homes with the luxuries of modern living. These tiny homes can be quickly shipped and set up anywhere around the country to offer a premium glamping experience complete with heating, cooling, a comfortable queen-sized mattress, and solar-powered outlets.\nWilson sells these tiny homes for $30k outright. However, property owners with a scenic plot of land who are interested in hosting can get their hands on Jupes for free. Here\u2019s how that works:\nJupe takes 30-50% of the rental revenue\nJupe rents for $250-$500 a night\nAnd the Jupe team will manage the entire rental process: the installation, repairs, bookings, etc.\nJupe reservations are made through platforms like Airbnb and Glamping hub.\nHow They Win\nThere are three main reasons why Jupe is such a success:\n1. They Picked The Right Trends\nWhen the pandemic hit in March of 2020, the hospitality industry took a massive downturn, but one niche soared into prominence: glamping.\nJupe launched in April 2020 and offered attractive nature vacations for urban residents looking to escape city living. In its first year, Jupe made an impressive $7 million in revenue.\n2. They Monetize An Underutilized Asset\nJupe is designed to be completely self-sufficient and operate off the grid. The MVP product is a solar-powered tent structure that pops up in a few hours, anywhere, and the software to find your happy place in nature.\nMeaning any landowner with a few extra acres can spin up a Jupe tent without the need for plumbing or any infrastructure.\n3. They're A Risk-Free 'Done For You' Solution\nJupes' \"just add land\" option means that landowners can generate extra revenue from unused land with no additional headaches. Jupe will set up and operate the business and landowners just collect checks at the end of the month.\nTOGETHER WITH HERE\nIf you run a business, here's an unlock to save ~80% on operating costs...\nAgent is an offshore recruiting agency that finds, vets, and facilitates the hiring of top-tier talent in the Philippines. You can hire amazing full-time employees starting at ~$800/month.\nHere's a few roles they're recruiting for:\nA SaaS CEO is hiring for an Sales Development Representative (SDR) for $1000/mo to scale his business.\nAn eCommerce business with $75m+ in revenue is hiring 2 Growth Marketers for $850/mo each to manage their paid acquisition.\nA regional pet franchise owner is hiring an Executive Assistant for $1000/mo to prioritize his calendar and tackle strategic projects.\nWant to see how much you could be paying?

In 2021, Amazon separated the \"other\" category, and last year the company generated $38bn in ad revenue, surpassing traditional media and the entire global newspaper industry.\nYou should know:\nAmazon's advertising business brought in $38bn with likely more than 50% operating margins.\nAt a 50% operating margin, its operating profit could be $20-25bn, comparable to that of AWS, its cloud business.\nThis also suggests that its advertising business generates more than its Prime membership business.\nRead more here.\nThe Capital Letter\nWe surface outlier businesses and share the tactics that power them.

Here's how they do it.\nBY SAM PARR\nMARCH 23, 2023\nThe world wants us to be vanilla. To put us into a box. And that's why when I come across original thinkers and characters like the founders of Jupe, I get hypnotized by their quirkiness. \nToday's interview is with Hampton member Antonio Gonzalez and his partner Jeff Wilson, the founders of Jupe. \nTheir product is fascinating. They're high-tech tents that don't feel like tents (and don't call them a tent...they don't like that!). The company gives Jupes to customers with land for free and Jupe takes a 30% cut of rental revenue. \nPlus, before founding Jupe, Wilson lived in a dumpster to test different ideas (seriously). \nJupe is on track to do $12 million in sales this year and has raised $9.5 million from people like Garry Tan and Y-Combinator. \nHere's their story...\n*****\nJupes were designed and engineered by former SpaceX and Tesla Employees for an experience unlike anything on Earth.\nWho are you, and what business did you start?\nMy name is Jeff Wilson, and along with my co-founder, Antonio (a Hampton member), we run Jupe. We make products that allow landowners to pop-up a nature hospitality site in a day, instantly activating and monetizing an underutilized asset. \nIt's essentially like finding money buried on your land. \nOur main product is a bedroom that can drag and drop anywhere in nature \u2014 ready to rent in under two hours. We either sell the units or rev-share them with little to no capex required on the part of the landowner. We're on track to do $12 million in revenue this year. Our longer goal is to use our technology to enable the build of a pop-up, off-grid living experience anywhere on the planet, complete with caf\u00e9s, internet via Starlink, restaurants, and even saunas. \nJupes set up on pieces of land across North America that rent for $200-400/night.\nWhat's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?\nThis all started when I decided to live a year in a dumpster as a sort of tiny living experiment. \nOver the course of the year in the dumpster, I learned to design tiny spaces and saw the opportunity for micro-units, also known as ADUs (accessory dwelling units). I raised some money and launched Kasita, a tiny smart home that was stackable and, conceptually, movable.\nUltimately, Kasita failed. I was left with $100,000 in credit card debt and became severely down on myself.I decided the best thing to do was to move to a small desert town in west Texas called Marfa \u2014 specifically into a non-air conditioned trailer (with a heart on it no less) and resolved to live my days out just working a bar out there, as a failure.\nBut one day I saw a photo of EV automaker Rivian's Skateboard Chassis and thought - hmm - we could do that for housing. During my Kasita days, I did meet a guy named Antonio during the process and we later went on to found Jupe. Jupe is essentially a flat-packed bedroom that can be dragged and dropped into nature and popped up and ready to rent. \nDumpster exterior with retracting roof and A/C.\nTake us through the process of building the first version of your product.\nI knew from my days at Kasita that it was extremely important to get a hardware product out into the hands of customers (even if it didn't meet code/zoning regs) so I told our first engineer that we would need to go from some designs on paper to someone actually sleeping in the unit in less than 60 days.\nThe engineer didn't seem to have much of a problem with this, because Elon had instructed him to do the same with the first star hopper rocket in south Texas except Elon had only given him five weeks :-)\nForm CTA\nThe thing was sorta a P.O.S. (as prototypes often are) but beautiful at the same time. We did manage to hit that deadline and even had the founder of Soylent stay in the prototype Jupe the very first night. The guy was used to experimenting on himself and dog food eating so he was perfect.\nYes, this is the inside of Jeff's dumpster.\nDescribe the process of launching the business.\nIn the beginning, we had a lot of trouble figuring out what product market fit would be. We initially started with concerts, but given that the company's first pitches to investors were in March 20 20 the pandemic pretty much shut that go-to-market down.\nWe then hard pivoted into Covid emergency shelters for hospitals, but it turned out that the hospitals didn't actually overflow, and even worse, there were no budgets at the hospitals to purchase or rent additional housing for emergency workers.\nWe eventually stumbled in to the $5 billion market of outdoor hospitality and discovered that it was growing about 17% with no major players in the industry OD more than even in 5% of that business, so this is where we chose to spend our time and have found that there are some real legs and real growth opportunities in this market. In the summer of 2021, we were admitted and funded by Y Combinator and this really upped our game, allowed us to raise money from some of the best investors in Silicon Valley, and attract the talent to build this rocket ship into a real thing and get it in the orbit.\nSince launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?\nThe number one mantra that we have is to ship product and talk to customers. We also have found that continuing to pound on our bigger mission of solving problems around construction, off grid, living, sustainability, and general housing needs have helped us to stay motivated as a team and attract top people that want to work on these problems and not just another SaaS product or App.\nOur marketing spend has been almost 0, and myself and my co-founder. Antonio are the key salespeople we have found that telling our bigger story and the story of our founders has generated interest and bars that have allowed us to acquire customers at a very low cost. As we develop further products, that ship faster and in tighter packages, we intend to move in to some new markets.\nHow are you doing today and what does the future look like?\nWe expect to do around $12M in revenue this year (about 400 units deployed) along with several very large Jupe's nature resorts (50+ Jupes). A growth strategy is to continue to acquire the best pieces of land and partner with landowners and ideal locations, and also to create a few new products that will round out our early go to market strategy as a denature hospitality provider of product.\nOur longer aim is to create what we call \"universal autonomous housing\" which is a very long word for popping up a village, anywhere on the face of the planet, and then moving that village very efficiently in a fleet-style fashion. We are looking to capture the future of humanity, and how folks want to live work, and play given movements towards remote work and climate change. \nDid you ever have an \"oh shit\" moment where you thought it wouldn't work?\nThe name of the game in hard tech start-ups is survival.\nEven Elon took over 15 years to really find his stride at both Tesla and SpaceX. And these are now two of the largest most innovative, most impactful companies on the planet.\nWe know that this is a long and a very hard game to play so we've had to make hard decisions along the way.\nFor example, in February 2021 the company had two weeks of cash and was considering shutting down, paying back deposits to customers, and paying severance to the employees that would be laid off. I had to make the hard decision to lay off the entire team besides myself, my co-founder, and one engineer and almost miraculously manage to find the cash from some angel investors, and then close more business than we had in the history of the company. And just those two weeks later we got into Y Combinator and were able to really get the fly wheel spinning at the company.\nJupe's first prototype.\nThrough starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?\nI think the biggest thing that we've learned is leaning into survival instinct, which sometimes means fight, and sometimes means flight. Keeping a very close eye on burn, cash in bank, and whether we are default alive, or default dead (great peace by Y Combinator, founder of Paul Graham).\nWhat platform/tools do you use for your business?\nWe're actually quite obsessive on our platforms. Here's a notion Page link to all 51 if you're interested. My personal favorites are Airtable for DB management and Notion for overall org and notes management (now with an epic AI integration). \nWhat have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?\n Book: The Creative Act: A Way of Being by Rick Rubin. By far the best extension of your creativity as a founder, I've found this work incredible. It's so dense that I have read it five times now and still finding new nuggets of wisdom.\nNews Source: The Information - best updates and insider stories on everything happening in the startup world.\n Podcast (after MFM of course): Lex Fridman Podcast. Super-nerd and robot boy Lex takes you on a long-form journey from the outer reaches of the cosmos to the minute bits of the self and back in a most humbling fashion. He's got great rapport and really burrows into the inner workings with everyone from Elon (interviewed three times) to Rogan to Grimes (explaining love here).\nAdvice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?\nGo for it and get started! You never know the right timing for an idea to really take off but if you don't start now, you can't go back to win the time might've been right. Launch early, launch often, and then listen to users and improve the product. It's better to go down in flames than to softly go out in a whimper. If you fail, don't go get a 'normal' job - go at it again. \nJupes...everywhere!\nAre you looking to hire for certain positions right now?\nJupe is always looking to hire folks into the mission and looking to get people deeper into nature and ultimately solve major housing issues. Have a look at our manifesto and vision page and reach out if anything looks interesting or if you have ideas that you think you should potentially explore.\nWhere can we go to learn more?\nIf you're interested in qualifying your land or buying a Jupe, then visit our partner page.\nOn the web at jupe.com\nInstagram @jupeinc\nOn Twitter @jupeinc\nFounders on Twitter @profdumpster and @antoniozalez\nVideo with Garry Tan, CEO of Y Combinator and lead investor at Jupe\nPersonally, I find being the CEO of a startup to be downright exhilarating. But, as I'm sure you well know, it can also be a bit lonely and stressful at times, too.\nBecause, let's be honest, if you're the kind of person with the guts to actually launch and run a startup, then you can bet everyone will always be asking you a thousand questions, expecting you to have all the right answers -- all the time.\nAnd that's okay! Navigating this kind of pressure is the job.\nBut what about all the difficult questions that you have as you reach each new level of growth and success? For tax questions, you have an accountant.

His work on sustainability and minimalism has been covered broadly by publications like Forbes, The Atlantic, NY Times, and The Washington Post.\n\n\nJeff talked to us about his \u201cDumpster Project\u201d as well as his previous and current startup ventures. As an entrepreneur, Jeff has founded and built a micro housing startup, Kasita, that was sold off in 2018. Jeff\u2019s latest company Jupe, has been a part of the recent Y Combinator batch, and Jeff also highlights what he learned from that experience.\n\n\nIn our conversation with Jeff we also discuss the details of how his current product works, the challenges of building a hardware company, picking the right co-founder, and\u2026 fundraising at the urinals.\nEpisode transcript\nGreg Miaskiewicz:\nSo, we'd like to talk about the very beginning stories on Startup Foundations. So how did you first become an entrepreneur? How did you get interested in big business startups, high-intensity interval capitalism?\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nI like that term. Is there an acronym?\n\n\nGreg Miaskiewicz: It's HIIC.\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nHIIC. Well, I'm a sixth generation Texan.\n\n\nGreg Miaskiewicz: Natural born HIIC.\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nSo it's a weird story. I've been an environmental science professor, a tenured professor. Safest job in the world. I decided I wanted to do this experiment around minimal living and around waste. So I convinced the university administration, to let me live in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year. An actual used trash dumpster and convert into a home. When you have aspirations as a professor of being part of the 1%, it's probably going to have nothing to do with wealth.\n\n\nSo I just went with, I'll live in 1% the volume of the average American home, own 1% of the stuff and consume 1% of the energy and water.\nSo did this and began moving my little dumpster house around the city and playing with coding officials and planning and learning how to design small spaces. And at one point, as you're laying in your dumpster at night, looking up at the heavens through the roof, this idea came to me of making the iPhone of housing. An integrated piece of hardware and software.\n\n\nOf course, there's an iPhone at Tesla and Uber and everything I learned later. But it seemed like a good\nenough idea. I moved out of the dumpster, raised my first check and started a company called Kasita.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD FULL TRANSCRIPT\nVideo Clips from Episode\nQUESTION | 2:16\nHow did you first become an entrepreneur?\nWATCH\nQUESTION | 2:26\nHow did you get your first money in the door?\nWATCH\nQUESTION | 2:41\nWhat should first-time founder look for when picking a co-founder?\nWATCH\nMore ways to listen\nSPOTIFY\nAPPLE\nSPREAKER\nGOOGLE\nRelated Episodes\nReady to get started?\nCreating a company on Capbase is as easy as filling out a few forms.\nSIGN UP NOW\nCHAT NOW\nDon't pay until you are ready to incorporate\nStartup founders use Capbase to incorporate, issue stock, raise funds, onboard new hires, and more.\nPRODUCT\nHome\nFeatures\nPricing\nHelp Center\nFAQ\nStartup Equity Calculator\nCapbase Connect\nCOMPANY\nAbout\nBlog\nPodcast\nContact\nTOPICS WE WRITE ABOUT\nSTARTUP FUNDRAISING\nINCORPORATION\nFOUNDER EQUITY\nSTARTUP EQUITY\nSTARTUP COMPLIANCE\nSTARTUP FINANCE\nGUIDES FOR BUILDING YOUR STARTUP\nFundraising For Startups\n15 ARTICLES\nHow To Set Up Your Company\n19 ARTICLES\nOngoing Compliance For Startups\n11 ARTICLES\nStartup Equity\n12 ARTICLES\nINCORPORATION MATTERS\nHow To Register A US Business From Mexico\nHow To Register a US Company from Nigeria\nDelaware Corporation Search: Check if your name is available in DE\nRead more\nFOUNDER EQUITY MATTERS\nHow Much Equity Should You Give to Your Junior Co-Founder?\nWhat Startup Founders Should Know About Capital Gains Tax\nWhat is a down round in startup financing?\nRead more\nSTARTUP EQUITY MATTERS\nLiquidation preference: A Guide For Startup Founders\nWhat is a down round in startup financing?\nPreferred Stock: Quick Guide For Startup Founders\nRead more\nTerms of servicePrivacy policy",

This is Jackson Steger, and you're listening to Season 2 of Campfire, but you knew that already. Let's get it.\n[00:00:11] This season of Campfire seeks to understand how to build new cities. Each week we are joined by experts and practitioners from different startup cities who will share the stories and lessons that they have learned from experimenting with radical new models of living. Cabin is building its own network city, which you can learn more about by visiting www.creatorcabins.com or by following us on Twitter @CreatorCabins.\n[00:00:33] Today, we're switching it up. We've had two guests at once before, but never have we had two guests from two different organizations on the show at the same time. Natalie Rens, CEO of Astreia, and Jeff Wilson, CEO of Jupe, are both building companies in the prefab space. It became pretty clear to the team at Campfire, after our conversations with Phil, Freeman, Gene and Zach, that regardless of approach to building new cities, we're going to need someone to help do the literal building of infrastructure that houses people.\n[00:01:04] Prefab could be a viable and flexible option. I am reading from Wikipedia here. Prefab refers to the specialist dwelling types of prefabricated buildings, which are manufactured offsite in advance, usually in standard sections that can be easily shipped and assembled. Jeff and Natalie have distinct but occasionally overlapping approaches to this model. I was thrilled and grateful to have experts like them on the show. We compared notes from their respective strategies, and I tried to understand how fast hardware and comprehensive software platforms, like theirs, might be able to work together to help build the cities of the future. I hope you enjoy, and as always, if you have feedback, you can reach out to us @CreatorCabins, or you can DM me personally on Twitter @JacksonSteger. Thanks.\n[00:01:49] Natalie and Jeff, welcome to Campfire.\n[00:01:52] Natalie Rens: Thank you.\n[00:01:53] Jeff Wilson: Hey, good to be here.\n[00:01:52] Jackson Steger: So this season so far, we were talking about before we hit record, has been all about building new cities. So far, we've talked with a coliving and walkability thought leader, a pair of educators building temporary cities, and the author of www.startupcities.com. Today, I'm really excited because you're both practitioners in the prefab building space, and perhaps building some of the infrastructure for some of the future cities and current cities that we've talked about on this show. So, before we go any further, I would love if you could both, in a few sentences, tell our audience what your respective companies do and describe the structures that you each build. And Natalie, I'll let you go first.\n[00:02:39] Natalie Rens: Sure, Founder and CEO of Astreia. The ultimate goal for us is to build the first development on Mars. And so, a lot of our design constraints is geared towards how do you produce housing that is very rapid to ship and assemble, has to be able to be packed very efficiently as well, and then once you assemble it, have it be self-sustaining eventually. Mars is obviously slightly resource constrained, so we work on doing that on Earth, creating panelized IKEA-style housing that we produce offsite. We package and ship the containers, ship, assemble it, and then we're really working on more of the large-scale developments on Earth and trying to reach a bit more climate sustainability here.\n[00:03:21] Jeff Wilson: Yeah. So, Jupe is what we call autonomous off-grid housing platform. And so, what we are building is the ability to set up off-grid a village in a day. So that\u2019s not only the living unit, it's all the infrastructure that you might have in a typical city with a Starlink set up anywhere on the face of the planet. And so, the sort of ideals we're working towards are that housing, there's no reason it should be plugged into the grid, and there's no reason it should be plugged into a specific piece of land. So, not only will these villages set down in a day, but then they will flat pack up and ship out in a day. So, that's what we\u2019re doing.\n[00:04:08] Jackson Steger: And I'd love to hear just a little bit more about the structures for both of you that are currently available, and we'll go and reverse order there. Jeff, back to you.\n[00:04:17] Jeff Wilson: Yeah. So, we started on the winter solstice of 2020, the first pandemic year. To date, we're set up at 17 sites, 13 of those sites in the last 90 days. We've made about 90 Jupes, and we can make 40 a month. So, we have a 40,000 sq. ft. facility in Houston where we make these right now. They basically consist of a chassis that's about 8.5 wide by 13 long by about 18 inches high. And inside that chassis we pack the entire body of the living unit. And right now, these living units are essentially soft top tents, if you will, but with solar, all the furniture, the lighting, the bedding, all that stuff packed into that volume to give a really comfortable like sleeping experience.\n[00:05:07] Right now, specifically our kind of Tesla roadster, if you will, is the glamping market. That's how we're getting going as we build out our infrastructure. We've also just deployed our first few toilets as well. So, that's where we are.\n[00:05:22] Jackson Steger: Natalie, I want to also come to you in a second. But just for the audience, Jeff, you call this glamping model your Tesla Roadster. Could you explain, with using Tesla as that example, what exactly that means in terms of your long-term strategy for the audience?\n[00:05:35] Jeff Wilson: Yeah, long term we want to solve housing problems for, first, a hundred million folks that are displaced through climate disasters, refugees, homeless. And then later we want to serve a big portion of the 1.5 billion people on the planet without adequate housing. However, it's very difficult, especially in the hard tech space, to leap there. I don't know, relative to Tesla, how difficult that would have been to leap to a model three. So, we've got to start with something that's not as regulated, that\u2019s much more profitable, that may be a smaller kind of market.\n[00:06:12] So, we've been able to immediately deploy into this kind of glamping space, if you will, and begin to get revenue and dial in our manufacturing, so we can get down to where we're making a Jupe in less than a minute, which is our goal within a couple of years to get to, which my co-founder made a Cadillac Escalade pushed one out the door every 57 seconds. So, right now, and in the foreseeable future, I think our little tents will be less complicated than an Escalade.\n[00:06:46] Jackson Steger: I can imagine that is quite true. Natalie, I'm curious how you think about the structures that you offer now. And then also, I imagine the longer-term vision for Astreia is that you will build these smart homes at scale across Earth and then advancing towards this development on Mars, like you said. How does thinking about development on Mars influence how you're designing your homes on Earth right now?\n[00:07:13] Natalie Rens: Yeah, so I would say that we're a little bit more in the permanent housing or like primary residential housing sector than Jeff is. So, we target at this moment in time 850 to 1500 sq. ft. housing. Very permanent. Our walls are 6 to 8 inches thick because we're obviously trying to reach a point of sustainability on your energy and also your water, and eventually your air systems as well. We have a development under development now. It's 125 rooms and that\u2019s really our first target. And I think we are similar in terms of we want to be able to produce very rapidly, very scalable housing. And so, offsite for a couple days production, and then at this moment, we're about seven days on-site, and we would like to get to the point in time that we can be at one day per house on-site. For comparison, the average single-family home in the U.S. takes seven months to construct as of today. So, we're fairly inefficient in the construction industry.\n[00:08:10] I think some of the design constraints that we consider are we are very heavy on how do we actually design our structure so that it can be packed even today in our shipping containers. And so, we have a constant kind measurement of how many of the homes could fit in the shipping containers and could fit on the Starship, that\u2019s probably around roughly 14, although obviously their metrics will change over time. And so, we want to get down to having much lighter structures that are still just as efficient and much thinner as well, so lower mass. And so, that's a primary driving force on how do we actually ship things, what are needed to Mars, but also how do you produce a scalable prefab company on Earth, which I think a lot of people have actually tried and failed at today quite perfectly. So, I think that's one section.\n[00:08:52] And then obviously the other side is that once it's there, you want it to be easy to build, and then you have to be just insanely efficient at every single part. And it's not just your resource usage, but it's also just how do you design a structure, so that it has better pressure systems and that just you\u2019re using less material to actually create the habitable space.\n[00:09:12] And then even in our materials, we don't use any wood because we're never going to grow trees on Mars. At least by the time I'm dead, we won't be dead. So, it's kind of, yeah, we work a lot with materials. We started with steel. We're working towards composites because that would be more likely. And I think we don't necessarily design specifically to Mars due to the constraints that I\u2019ve highlighted.\n[00:09:30] Jackson Steger: I appreciate you saying that. You mentioned how there have been lots of attempts in this space. And yeah, I'm curious because both of you referenced the speed and efficiency plays of prefab. And so, I would love for both of you to take this question, and whoever wants to can jump in first, but what exactly does it mean for something to be prefab, and like why hasn't that been the status quo in the last hundred years, if it\u2019s so efficient? Like what are the challenges keeping it from being so mainstream?\n[00:10:05] Jeff Wilson: I\u2019ll let you go, Natalie.\n[00:10:07] Natalie Rens: Yeah, sure. I think prefab is primarily, so it's anything that is produced offsite in a factory rather than being onsite construction. The two main models are that you either produce modular housing or structures. And so, these are what you typically see as these boxes that are shipped aside or manufactured homes. And then the other option is to do panelized construction, which is what we do, and that's more the kind of IKEA focus. So, you make that kind of components, and you ship that kind of components and then you wrap it onsite.\n[00:10:35] I think prefab is actually much more heavily adopted in places like Europe already. I think there are some cultural elements there. There's a lot more push for high quality builds, sustainable builds. They have a much denser population. I think the U.S. was a little bit tarnished at I think the manufactured housing industry, and we did actually have the Sears catalog homes back in, or what was that, like a hundred years ago, which were wildly successful and then collapsed, and we just never really saw the return of that here.\n[00:11:03] I think we're now reaching a point where the construction industry, which is very strong in the U.S. and in some ways does lobby against other technology, it's reaching a point where the cost of labor and the shortage of labor and the cost of material is forcing people to have to go this route, even against the kind of pushback that you get here.\n[00:11:22] And I think the other side that you just have to consider when you are a prefab company is that you have a very heavy CapEx in a very constrained market. And so, traditionally this has killed a lot of companies because if you only have a 500-mile radius or so that you can serve in the housing industry around, you collapse as we die and all the other construction and the much more flexible construction companies survive, and I think that's one thing that at least we've taken into consideration on how do we actually expand that way, so that when you have these local fluctuations that you have, that you can actually continue to supply.\n[00:11:54] Jackson Steger: Anything to add there, Jeff?\n[00:11:55] Jeff Wilson: Yeah, I think she's broken it down right. You're either shipping air or you're not shipping air. If you're shipping air, then a lot of the labor complexity gets taken out onsite. So, a mobile home, a big box, right? Like a container house or something, but we won't get into container houses, but a big box. So, you get it to site, you drop it on a slab, you plug it in. It can be pre-permitted by the state at the state level, an old Nixon era kind of rule.\n[00:12:25] And then there's the other, which gets more complicated. And I would put most of the stuff, you know, what Natalie is doing in panelizing, what I'm doing with flat-packing and popping up, I would even say the 3D-printed robot how are similar as well to where there's a lot of complexity on.\n[00:12:43] And so, what I think people run into when you are assembling things onsite, which I'm included in this as well, is what I call like The Home Depot parking lot test. So, if you can't go down to The Home Depot and pick up a couple of guys and bring them over to the site, when somebody doesn't show up, and you need those guys to work on your technology, it adds a lot of problems around scale to the actual modular build. So, in a regular build, if you need somebody to pour a foundation, to put up a wall, to tape and float something, you can generally find folks to do that stuff. But you put a SIP panel or a 3D printer, or even a Jupe in front of these folks, they're typically not, those skillsets are not going to exist at a very wide set.\n[00:13:37] So, I think one of the issues and one of the problems that Natalie and I are both probably trying to solve for is lessening that complexity of bringing it out of the container and getting it set up, or in my case, getting it off the truck and popped up. So that's the trade-off. The kind of modular promise, as they've called it, that goes back to Buckminster Fuller who was working on this stuff like back in the 30\u2019s, is that like modular housing, modular prefab will be faster, higher quality, and cheaper. And really we haven't hit any of those, even two of those three, but definitely not the cheaper so far. I think, ultimately, modular prefab needs to be probably 40% cheaper than a typical build for developers to really pick it up and run with it, in my opinion.\n[00:14:28] Natalie Rens: I think we're seeing a bit more bites even at a kind of like median market price, but I think there are, if you're working, for example, as a B2B selling to developers, you also get a lot of costs just by being faster. And so, if you can genuinely be faster than a traditional construction build, then for a developer, that means that they are getting lower interest that they have to pay, they\u2019re getting towards tenants moving in, so they're generating revenue faster, and then also for their investors who are getting that return back. And so, I think that generates more capital, even if you're at that median. But definitely historically, we've had companies that actually would be more expensive than, some of the even startups that are out there right now are selling it at like $400 a square foot.\n[00:15:08] Jeff Wilson: Oh wow.\n[00:15:09] Natalie Rens: Yeah, like for things that are actually smaller. And so, I think that is where that promise is not.\n[00:15:15] Jackson Steger: I would bet that both of you had a large number of prototypes, or at least an iterative design process, but correct me if I'm wrong. I'm curious what you would recommend to other builders, architects, engineers who might be listening to this, who are thinking about designing their own prefab structures. How should they approach the problem? And maybe what would you have done differently in the earliest days of your company when you were designing the structures?\n[00:15:44] Jeff, I see that you're listed as Chief Design Officer in addition to being the CEO. So, maybe do you want to start, and then Natalie will go over to you?\n[00:15:52] Jeff Wilson: Yeah. So, we went through Y Combinator Summer batch last year, and 90% of the company is on Y Combinator software companies. And there's a reason, right? It's just a whole lot easier to scale a software company, and it's a whole lot easier to iterate. And what happens to us in the hard tech space is just moving atoms around, having to occupy space time is a really difficult thing to do with fast capital, with venture capital. And one of these like main axioms is launching early, pushing stuff out earlier than you think it's ready. And I think we've really followed that with Jupe. Like we put our first Jupe out, that was one of our early prototypes, and I got the founder of Soilet to sleep in it. Like he had been eating his own dog food for a while as he was creating Soilet, and I'm like, bro, you can handle sleeping in a Jupe that's unpermitted in someone's backyard in L.A. for a week and give us some feedback.\n[00:17:00] As long as nobody is going to get hurt in the process of what you're doing, I think my biggest encouragement is if you're building any kind of housing product, to get folks living in it, whether it's yourself or someone else, as soon as possible, and start that feedback loop between, hey, this is what the user says, improve the product. This is what the user says, improve the product. So, in brief, I think getting folks in your prototypes as soon as possible and getting them built is really important in this space.\n[00:17:34] Natalie Rens: Yeah. I'd say we did a similar approach where we got our contract, like offer was built insanely fast, and we had no time. They came to us on a Friday, and we had to have the target done by the Wednesday next week. And so, it was just whole fire. And we went out onto that build, and we made a thousand mistakes because we were learning every single step of that process, and we were working with composite material, et cetera. And so, there was a lot there that was new, and I think that we went straight into doing that and we built it. And I think that was the most terrible thing we could possibly have done because I think even the intensity of having taken that route and we had a very strict timeline on the build meant that we didn't have that time to sit there and overengineer things. We had to really just make those mistakes and learn from them and then go again.\n[00:18:16] And yeah, we took that and we went, we took lot of those learnings into our next alteration. And then while we\u2019re in that next kind of design phase, we actually talked to some engineers, we just got this design, like the light bulb, and then went onto our third alteration. And very much we're a lot more oriented to so far in how do we actually build for the process. And so, we designed everything for the process and for the shipping. And then, ultimately, it'll be a little bit more mature in terms of, yeah, okay, let's start designing this more to a user experience side of it. But yeah, that's our main priority at this point in time.\n[00:18:45] Jackson Steger: Thanks for sharing. Natalie, on your website, you mentioned that your homes are smart homes, they have their own operating systems and sensors. Can you elaborate on why your homes have an operating system and how exactly that works?\n[00:19:00] Natalie Rens: Yeah. So, actually my background was in neuroscience and AI. And so, I actually came into Astreia very much more focused on, okay, if we're going to go to Mars, we probably want a really smart environment. You know, if any of these parameters, like oxygen, go wrong, you can fix this before it\u2019s a little bit too late. And so, it was actually the first thing that I focused on. And I think, one, obviously it's super important for Mars because that is the environment where a single parameter going wrong is game over, and it's really hard as a human to keep an entire environment officially sustainable for that long. And so, we need to have that. But then also on Earth, I think there are two applications, the first is sustainability and resilience. Even beyond just energy efficiency, water efficiency, thermal efficiency, if you can detect if there are faults in a home and you can keep the people safe and you can detect their water leaks, it's actually what causes most of our water waste in the U.S. at least. And then if you're like us, I think focusing a little bit more on the climate vulnerable areas as well, then if something hits here, a little bit more likely to be safe inside of that home.\n[00:20:02] And something also that we have that\u2019s just a functional aspect here, but then I think the longer-term play would be how do you create a very intuitive home. So, we start moving on to what we have now, which is energy monitoring, water monitoring, and environmental condition monitoring, motion lights and you start being able to detect what do people actually want when they get inside their homes, what things should be turned on, what needs to be turned off. So, instead of having to go there and be like, hey, Alexa, turn on the light, you actually just have a house that understands your patterns of behavior. And so, I think that's the much longer term.\n[00:20:32] Jeff Wilson: Yeah. Well, add to this, I think she's onto something really big here. No one has really Teslafied the home. People are laughing years ago when it's like why do you need an onboard computer on your car? What does Artificial Intelligence or machine learning, or why six cameras? This is ridiculous. It's a freaking car. What Tesla understood was that it was a computer on wheels and that they were essentially building an extension of that driver's experience in the car, almost more a gadget than a vehicle.\n[00:21:10] And I think the way that Natalie is thinking about this, and the way we're thinking about it as well, we have a Raspberry Pi in these now, we're developing an operating system. You'll be able to preheat your Jupe on the way back to it in the woods. You'll be able to hit a button and your Jupe will light up in the woods. They'll play happy birthday. We have IoT in our bathrooms where like bird noises will click on and things. Like we're doing a lot of really fun stuff right now with this platform. It's almost like the fireplace or the fart noise in the Tesla, we're having some fun with this Easter egg-wise. But I think ultimately we need to build a computer and an AI and a machine learning algorithm with four walls around it, rather than, the way we think about technology and IoT right now is I'm going to stick this barnacle, this thermostat, on the wall, and then I'm going to put this smart speaker thing over on a table and they don't talk and they weren't integrated from the beginning into the UX. It's similar to almost like installing a dashcam on a Camry right now relative to what you get out of a Tesla. So, I think it's a really smart way, they're moving, and we see a very similar future.\n[00:22:29] Jackson Steger: Yeah. I was going to ask you, Jeff, as well. Like the way you articulate it on your website is a universal autonomous housing vision, which I think is a really cool way to describe a shelter platform. I want to move away from software for a second just to the real world. So, you're both, to an extent, based in Texas and Cabin is as well. Our first, we call it Neighborhood Zero, is located about 45 minutes away from Austin. What is it about Texas that is so appealing to people in this space? Or is it just a coincidence?\n[00:23:07] Natalie Rens: I ended up there a little bit by accident. I arrived in the U.S. end of 2019. I was in L.A., pandemic hit, and I didn't really know that much better, but I knew that Tesla was about to sit up in Austin, and if really smart people are setting up in Austin, why not? I got out and went there more just because I figured there was slightly better manufacturing and tech available there.\n[00:23:28] Jackson Steger: Maybe the better question, have you faced any regulation? Either of you. And I guess that's where my question was leading. What have regulatory challenges been for either of you as you've started your companies, and what others might you anticipate as you continue to grow?\n[00:23:45] Jeff Wilson: Yeah. So, from a regulatory environment, we have purposely chosen to literally go out into the woods, the desert, the mountains, the forest to build out our platform, our technology, and our business with the idea that later we will begin to move these around and potentially come back towards the cities. When you're out in a distant county that might be near a national park or somewhere where people want to stay, we don't have to go through the same level of regulatory process. We've also designed the Jupe such that they don't ever attach to the grid, they don't need a foundation, they're not on wheels, they don't have water in them right now, they set up an hour and a half and they take down an hour and a half. So, they're non-permanent. And so, that actually gets us around. The Jupe doesn't really fit into a category right now. And so, it allows us to go a little bit faster from a regulatory standpoint as well. That probably won't last forever, but that's been our strategy at this point.\n[00:24:46] Natalie Rens: Yeah. I think Texas is obviously a little bit more of a regulatory haven than California is, especially for building. I think trying to build in California is impossible if you're, like even if you're trying to do water reuse, it can take you years to get permits there. And so, I think Texas definitely has an advantage there, and I'd say Florida as well.\n[00:25:05] I'd say, in general, our approach has been to go quite top down. And so, we went and spoke to City of Brownsville coming into the first build, and I think I'm currently visiting Florida just looking at our next pipeline, and the first step was to meet with every single county down here and just see where are the housing crisis, what are the kind of drivers here for both workforce kind of housing or median\u2019s affordable housing and also sustainability. And if you\u2019re going from that direction, then you get a lot more buy-in to say, hey, we're actually coming to help your county, or we're coming to help your city, what can we do here to make sure that we're expediting this kind of problems that you have. And I found so far that it's a better strategy. And the U.S. is also not the only market. There are a lot of other countries where you can build faster because the bureaucracy is a little bit less. And so, we strategize moving out according to where we can build the fastest. And if you can then build in those places, you use that as a precedent to then go to places that are a little bit harder to.\n[00:25:57] Jackson Steger: So, as you bring up other markets outside of the U.S. and just growing in general, the question that we have at Cabin is, not just houses or glamping units or any other number of individual structures be built out of prefab, but can we build entire prefab cities? And I know you both have your different approaches to this.\n[00:26:25] Natalie, I want to start with you just with that as the question, but also as a follow-up, what is Habitat Zero?\n[00:26:33] Natalie Rens: I think building the structure for a city is not necessarily the harder part, right? Like you do have to be able to build at scale and at speed if you\u2019re trying to get this realized in any moment of time on the scale of the network states, et cetera. I think the problem with the cities is to be able to actually introduce the necessity for culture and schooling and work and et cetera, and it's much more a political, societal problem than it is a technical problem, I would say.\n[00:27:01] Habitat Zero is, I think, obviously the zero or the first test for how do you start to build something that is at more a production level. We went in there. We did the entire site plan to make sure that it was sustainable. It's 125 homes. We do have two commercial lots on there. And so, we are trying to incorporate some other amenities, but really the focus for that was how do we reach production immediately, have 125 homes go up. They sit on their own microgrids, so it's all and that\u2019s their energy. They're tied in with solar panels, Tesla Powerwalls, with a back-up on there as well. I think it\u2019s step one in terms of how do you have a sustainable community. I think it addresses their residential portion. It doesn't really address the entire of their, the rest of what you need for a city to operate, but at least you have somewhere to live. We do have a space bar. So\u2026\n[00:27:50] Jackson Steger: Jeff, your website while there's no, I'm specifically talking about your TLDR/Notion page. While there is the word \u201cearthlings\u201d, there\u2019s no specific mention of Mars, but instead you referenced the idea that you could put 300,000 Jupes on a ship and do like the sea setting approach. Why might that be a viable idea and a good one?\n[00:28:15] Jeff Wilson: I want to go back to what Natalie briefly mentioned there, the network state. I think the thing that's been overlooked in the whole network state architecture is the actual infrastructure. And I think the way that we are approaching this at Jupe, if you are going to take the network state one commandment, I think it\u2019s what it's called, not the first commandment, but what are you setting everything up on, I would say ours is non-attachment. And a non- attachment, not in just a Buddhist sense to material possessions or this world, but I think that means non-attachment to the land, non-attachment to the grid, non-attachment to any one particular climate or space, and non-attachment to any one particular resident.\n[00:29:11] So, what we are building out is a dynamic fleet of not only tents right now, but then bathrooms, Zoom rooms, saunas, community areas, yoga areas, that is dynamic in space and time, such that that fleet does not ever have to attach to a specific archipelago of land. And so, what that makes us able to do is flex up and flex down as per the population wants to be migratory.\n[00:29:44] So, I think we have a render on our website of a ship with 300,000 living units of Jupes. That may be a ship that's loaded up either to go to an archipelago of land, as they're called in Puerto Rico, or it could be re-deployed to hate in the sense of, say there's another earthquake, or loaded up and shipped over to Europe for a new network state that might be set up in the south of France. So, what we're really trying to do is build a fleet model of housing and infrastructure that's dynamic and not tied to, attached, if you will, to any one particular place per sole grid.\n[00:30:29] Natalie Rens: How do you reconcile this kind of non-attachment theory with the requirement for infrastructure, like your energy systems, water systems, food systems, which all tend to operate much more effectively when they are at scale? So, to have your own water tank is actually much less effective than it is to have a water system, to have a connected microgrid for your energy is much more efficient than to have to have four days of battery or seven days of battery because you never know if there's\u2026food systems are obviously very location-dependent still as of today. So, how do you provide all the actual infrastructures necessary for those?\n[00:31:01] Jeff Wilson: Yeah, I was just off a call with our head of R&D talking about a water system. So, you're right, it's not efficient to put a water tank in every Jupe, or even when we have four Jupes together and a hard wall on top of it in a 400 sq. ft. like Jupe, it's not efficient to have a water tank in each one of those. It's probably not efficient to have a bathroom in each one of those. It's not efficient to have just one photovoltaic array hooked up to one battery in one inverter.\n[00:31:30] So, the way we're thinking about this is one entire Jupe chassis, if you will, can hold 1200 gallons. Five of those stacked up is 6,000 gallons. You've got a water tank there that then could be distributed. We could have one central battery array with solar panels, where those batteries were transportable to the individual Jupes, or we could wire it up.\n[00:31:55] So, I'm thinking that these villages of these not really network cities but network villages may be around 400 or 500 residents each, such that they could set up in this sort of micro-distributed fashion. It's a very hard problem. Anybody that's dealt with this, we might fail. I think it's possible per first principles, so we're going to go for it, but it's a really hard thing to do, especially to give people a latte and their deep nature and their off-grid thing as well, the comfort you want in a city that you wanted.\n[00:32:31] Jackson Steger: Natalie, you mentioned, and also I love that you asked the question, one of the questions I was going to have towards the end, and maybe we'll still do it was, what questions do you have for each other. So, I love that you started with that. I also was going to ask a water question. I love it. You mentioned, or you said like Habitat Zero, Neighborhood Zero, this idea that it's the first experiment in your prefab city, so to call it. How might you select other habitats moving forward? What kind of criteria do you look for? I know in Habitat Zero it's proximity to Star base I'm sure is a factor. What might other locations for a habitat look like? And the same question could be asked of you, Jeff, and I'll let you go after Natalie.\n[00:33:14] Natalie Rens: So, in terms of location or land selection?\n[00:32:31] Jackson Steger: Correct.\n[00:33:17] Natalie Rens: I prefer to build in places where you know that you're generally making an impact with what you're doing, and like the locations for us are where there is a massive housing crisis. And so, just demand for housing in that area is insane. We are moving towards a multifamily model in the future. And so, we will start stacking our housing as well because most places, where there's a crisis, they're running out of land. And so, they don't really want these sprawling cities. And in some ways, if you consider Mars, you typically picture these little round domes sitting on Mars. But if you think about what you're trying to do with a big city, you're actually trying to reduce the amount of surface area that you have exposed to this very toxic environment. And I think even for Mars, we're considering more of this kind of like condos on Mars approach. So, that's something that we're waiting to do in the future instead of selecting cities or areas of Miami, etc., or even around the (00:34:04) where there's a lot of space activity ramping up where there is a massive need.\n[00:34:08] And then the other thing that is exciting for us is to build in places where if you build there, that you're protecting them from hurricanes or floods or, I think another key target for us is Poland-Ukraine because there's a massive need for housing there. And if you can come in and rebuild fast and they would otherwise have, then you're giving people a home back. And so, that's what we tend to focus on.\n[00:34:27] Jackson Steger: That's awesome. Anything to add, Jeff, in terms of how you assess potential spots for a lot of Jupes?\n[00:34:36] Jeff Wilson: Yeah. Right now, it's do they have L.A. weather, good weather, and it is near a kind of beautiful deep nature with a view. Again, ultimately, we want to house a hundred million people, displaced people. But what we need to do now is meet our Roadster market, which are folks that want to go into deep nature in a high design unit and pay for that experience.\n[00:35:01] So, right now, the great thing about Jupe is we don't acquire to just add land. So, all of our partners, if somebody's got a nice piece of land with a great view and good weather, our business model is that we drop our units on their land for nothing, and then we just RevShare. So, we put it on our booking platform, and we take a percentage of the revenue rather than selling something that will be there forever. So yeah, that opens up a lot of options I think for us in terms of how we do this.\n[00:35:33] Jackson Steger: Awesome. As we approach close, first of all, I just want to thank you both for joining. It's been awesome having this conversation and then also seeing the cross conversation too between you. I do want to ask that question, which is, what is the question that you have for each other. As you're in your sort of separate niches, building and building, I'm sure that there are like specific technical questions or other curiosities that I might not be able to think of, but maybe you have for each other. And if you don't, then great, we'll scrap this. But Jeff, maybe do you want to start anything that Natalie's working on that you want to ask her and then we\u2019ll\u2026\n[00:36:11] Jeff Wilson: I think I would like to know, if you can only bring one thing to Mars, out of your house or bedroom to put in your house on Mars, what would you bring? It's a whole question of like your house is on fire and you've got to run out, but you're going to Mars to set up in your new house, what\u2019s the one thing?\n[00:36:28] Natalie Rens: If this this like a practical question, my laptop because that would be probably pretty useful.\n[00:36:32] Jeff Wilson: Okay. That works.\n[00:36:35] Natalie Rens: I don\u2019t know. I'm actually one of those I pack up and I move. And I've done this. I've lived in seven countries. I've lived all over, and so I've never had really any material ties whatsoever. I think the one thing that I've carried with me through the countries is the tapestry from South Africa, like a big giraffe and I always put it up, but\u2026And then I'm pretty low-key. So, I'd say laptop seems like the most, yeah, practical thing I could possibly bring, and then it has music on it. So, I feel like that kind of sets me up for life.\n[00:37:02] Jeff Wilson: Awesome.\n[00:37:03] Jackson Steger: I love that question.\n[00:37:04] Jeff Wilson: That\u2019s so inspiring.\n[00:37:05] Natalie Rens: Are you focused on ultimately getting to space as well?\n[00:37:07] Jeff Wilson: You know what, I, we will be listening for signals from space on how to further build out the Jupe platform, maybe SETI@home. We can tune into those guys and see if the aliens can just send us any instructions to help on Jupe, and then we can support all of the folks getting off, like yourselves. But for now, we don't have a many off planet ambitions. We're just trying to make it out in the desert, which may be similar to Mars.\n[00:37:40] Natalie Rens: Yeah.\n[00:37:42] Jackson Steger: Whether it's the desert or on Earth or the desert in Mars, I know my one item is going to be SPF, a million sunscreen, to survive those harsh marching UV rays. Thank you both so much for coming. Any call to action that you want to give to our audience in terms of next steps if they're interested in learning about either of your companies? I'll just go in the order I have you on my screen. Natalie, do you want to start?\n[00:38:06] Natalie Rens: Yeah. We're about to do a re-design, but go to the website. It has relatively most of the stuff on there. So, www.astrea.com. We tend to post a little bit more maybe on Instagram. We should probably do a little bit more of that. But yeah, I think just in general, if you're excited about sustainability or space, then yeah, reach out. And if there's any ways that we can help out or engage, we\u2019ll start to (00:38:25) that.\n[00:38:27] Jackson Steger: Awesome. And for you, Jeff?\n[00:38:28] Jeff Wilson: Cool. Yeah. I would love to have folks come down and visit our site south of San Francisco in the redwoods. We have a secret mezcal bar there and a really cool bathroom, we call the portal, that looks more like a time machine. So, if anybody is coming out to the Bay Area, we rent that place out to groups. We\u2019re happy to give folks a tour. They can just reach out to me on Twitter @ProfDumpster or go to www.jupe.com and they can reach us there.\n[00:39:01] Jackson Steger: Great. We'll have to do this again over mezcals in the redwoods. Jeff, Natalie, thank you both so much for coming.\nEND OF TRANSCRIPT\nSubscribe to Cabin\nReceive the latest updates directly to your inbox.\nSubscribe\nMint this entry as an NFT to add it to your collection.\nMint\nVerification\nThis entry has been permanently stored onchain and signed by its creator.\nARWEAVE TRANSACTION\nIuYHEkUNKXnkOX-\u2026YnE0BlCC6TKKA-A\nAUTHOR ADDRESS\n0xC1908D8aA51fEa2\u2026a01f8Bf2ff1225d\nCONTENT DIGEST\nd_HW0mC_9SxxCCX\u2026u02tabaXrJ90PPY\nMore from Cabin\nView All",

There are about 1.5 billion people in the world that still don\u2019t have adequate shelter. If you\u2019re going to work on big problems here on earth, that\u2019s one worth working on.\u201d\nIt seems like Garry Tan from Initialized and the gang over at Y Combinator agree \u2014 they just secured a roof over Jupe\u2019s head for a few months with a $9.5 million seed round. The money will be spent on building out the team and continuing its mission of housing the unhoused. To date, the company has received more than 300 preorders, and has started shipping Jupe shelters to a number of locations.\n\u201cJupe\u2019s vision of universal autonomous housing will ultimately allow anyone to live anywhere on the planet, comfortably and with an internet connection via satellite. It\u2019s something the world has been waiting for,\u201d commented Initialized Capital founder and managing partner, Garry Tan. \u201cThey are building a first-of-its-kind hard tech and software platform for the world.\u201d\nJupe\u2019s mission sure isn\u2019t shy, and its founder is a character and a half, but he\u2019s got the passion and mad scientist vibe to pull it off.\n\u201cI lived in a dumpster for a year, because I wanted to try to live using 1% of the volume, and 1% of the energy used of the average American home,\u201d Wilson told me in a recent interview, before shifting gears and explaining how he landed with the idea for Jupe: \u201cI have a PhD in environmental science, and I think climate change plays into what we are doing. We don\u2019t have to pour any foundations, we aren\u2019t hooked into the grid or tied to a particular plot of land. Jupe is a step forward in solving the housing crisis that impacts 1.5 billion people annually. Jupe units are 10 times cheaper and faster to deploy than traditional temporary, mobile housing solutions, and ship 15 times more efficiently. On top of that, its unique design provides dignified lodging for everyone \u2014 with an internet connection.\u201d\n\u201cGarry Tan, who led the investment round, coined the term universal autonomous housing. That\u2019s a really good descriptor of what we are doing here,\u201d Wilson explains, adding that he currently lives in one of the Jupe units in the middle of Soma in San Francisco \u201cFor right now, it\u2019s someone that wants to have a very high-design, very comfortable experience in nature, off grid. Longer term as we build out the technology, we will build for people that no longer want to live in the cities, that want to live with a community of folks out on a raw piece of land. From there we expect to widen that time horizon to where people are living in these for weeks, months, ultimately their entire life.\u201d\nThe current version of the Jupe shelter, the company\u2019s founder describes as an MVP. It\u2019s a sturdy construction with a chassis that houses the core technology of the shelters, with an aluminium exo-skeleton on top. It withstands high winds pretty well, but is primarily aimed at temperate climates, in the high 40\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) to high 80F (27\u00b0C) range.\n\u201cThe next version will have a hard top on it, so you\u2019ll be able to use it more of a four-season kind of environment,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cWith our existing structure, we can\u2019t take heavy snow loads. The ones we had in Colorado, we had to take down in winter. It\u2019s an evolution, though \u2014 we are a young company. We do have growth ambitions, though. We built our first Jupe in April of 2020, and we already have around $7 million of revenue booked.\nThe company wasn\u2019t eager to share its pricing model with us, and Wilson argues that it isn\u2019t relevant anyway; the company is hoping to build out a network of Jupes and place them on plots of lands. They then rent it out, and split the revenue 50/50.\n\u201cYou have no upfront cost, apart from a small licensing fee. We put it on our booking platform, and we hot-swap them out. If the Jupe on your land gets old, we come and replace it, almost like a car trade-in. We bring in the newest technology for you, and take the old one for another use case,\u201d explains Wilson. \u201cJust add land, that\u2019s our slogan.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s biggest challenge right now is to attract the right CTO who can take charge of the technical side of things \u2014 the company is looking for a technical, \u201calmost founder level CTO\u201d to help build the future of the technology platform.\n\u201cThey just have to be a good fucking human. There are so many assholes out there, and we need someone truly excellent. We\u2019re probably looking for someone with 15 years experience, who has had exposure both to startups, and managed and grown big teams. Someone who is really strong in the software side, but who has also done a bunch of integration stuff. This is a gadget; a device,\u201d explains Wilson, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a hard find, but we\u2019re going to spend a significant amount of money and equity on this person to get someone who is competitive, and who can help us get to the vision I have.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a bold vision \u2014 the company wants to house a hundred million people.\n\u201cI know everyone wants to go to Mars, but let\u2019s not give up on Earth quite yet,\u201d Wilson concludes. \u201cScrew the valuation of the company, this is what I want to do with the rest of my life. I need the best folks in the world who are also good humans.

And, he\u2019s offering them for free to anyone who will provide the land for rent (in exchange for splitting the rental income).\nThe Jupe units are fully off-grid and designed to ship flat-packed, enabling bulk deliveries of fifteen units on a single truck. \u201cArriving with all the essentials \u2018in the box\u2019\u2014including a luxury queen mattress and bed, furniture, LED lighting, solar panels and backup batteries, and even the linens\u2014Jupes assemble in a little over an hour and units are ready to rent the day they arrive,\u201d explains Wilson.\nDespite its canvas cladding Wilson calls it \u201cmore a device than a tent: Jupe\u2019s units are built on an innovative \u201cchassis\u201d foundation that gives them the flexibility to move quickly and freely, adapt to any terrain, and oftentimes forgo the necessity of building permits.\u201d This exoskeleton for housing allows for rapid assembly, and disassembly, requiring no foundation work, no platform, and no electrical utility drags, so \u201cpermits are rarely necessary\u201d.\nWilson says it wouldn\u2019t be hard to add SIPP panels or more conventional walls to make these adequate for longer-term living; currently they are ideal for not only short-term rentals, but as popup disaster relief shelter.\nOn the \u201cSlow Coast\u201d of California (north of Santa Cruz), Dr. Wallace Nichols lost his home to the 2020 CZU Lightning Complex fires and decided a big box of a house no longer makes sense and instead chose to purchase six Jupes for his 20-acre property that not only went up fast but could be moved fast in the event of another fire.\nJupe popup shelter tests Freemium for housing relief & stays.\nVideo on Kasita tiny prefab (Jeff\u2019s previous endeavor).\nEmailPocketInstapaperReddit\nRelated\nKasita: tiny prefab home-as-a-service for post-land urbanism\nJuly 24, 2016\nIn \"videos\"\nVipp Shelter tiny prefab as precise industrial-era appliance\nNovember 29, 2015\nIn \"videos\"\nModal is a backyard home to rent-out or dwell-in anywhere\nAugust 1, 2021\nIn \"videos\"\ntags: 1 hour prefab, affordable housing, agile housing, disaster housing, dumpster home, exoskeleton, exoskeleton housing, free upfront housing, high-tech shelter, instant housing, jeff wilson, jupe shelter, jupe village, kasita, kit of parts house, modular construction, modular housing, offgrid housing, plug and play solar, popup housing, prefab, prefab construction, professor dumpster, rapid deploy housing, relief housing, short-stay-as-service, slow coast, ssaas, village of jupe units\ndocumentaries\nbiokabin\ngotham micro-flats\n(un)housed\nwhat is \u201chome\u201d?\npandemic-proof\ntiny houses\npre-vanlife\nlean urbanism\ncategories\narticles\nvideos\nabout\n*faircompanies\nterms\nnicol\u00e1s boullosa\nkirsten dirksen\ncontact\nmedia kit\nAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (cc) | *faircompanies, since 2007",

From prefab tiny houses and modular cabin kits to entire homes ready to ship, their projects represent some of the best ideas in the industry. Do you know a prefab brand that should be on our radar? Get in touch!\nYears ago, when Jeffrey Wilson was just getting started in the prefab industry, he set his sights on glamping\u2014you know, camping, but for people who don\u2019t want to get dirty. But he soon ran into issues that only come with experience, like how much time it takes to get a permit and what constitutes a necessity in such a small space. With lessons learned\u2014some gleaned from living in a dumpster for a year\u2014Wilson launched Jupe in 2020.\n\"I wanted to design a prefab unit that was much more rapidly deployable, had far fewer codes to comply with, and was much less expensive,\" he says. \"I also wanted to make the process of setting it up much faster.\"\nIn the beginning, Jupe was still catering to those who wanted to escape into the wilderness with style: It has 11-foot ceilings and a spaceship-like frame that was designed by Tesla and SpaceX engineers, with a queen-sized mattress and Douglas fir details exuding comfort. But lately, that goal has changed, too.\n\"We are now hard pivoting into the \u2018displaced persons\u2019 market,\" Wilson says, joining a number of designers rethinking temporary living. He spoke to Dwell from Maui, where Jupe hopes it can provide aid in the form or housing to those affected by August\u2019s devastating wildfires. Below, Wilson discusses the reasons behind the plan, and what makes this prefab model worthy of the cause.\nJupe\u2019s ceilings are 11-feet tall, and it was designed to resemble a spaceship.\nWhat\u2019s the most exciting project you\u2019ve realized to date?\nWe specifically designed the Jupe so that it\u2019s under 120 square feet, which is often considered a shed. It is semi-permanent and does not require a slab or grid connections, so it has the ability to move without a trace. In the past, we\u2019ve worked with folks who wanted to add quick accommodations to their land, but now we\u2019re creating a client base that\u2019s primarily focused on housing people who have been displaced by climate disasters.\nCurrently, 12 Jupe units can fit on one standard 40-foot flatbed trailer. Soon, we hope to be able to fit 24 units. This would make it easier to get shelter to people in need faster.\nWhat does your base model cost and what does that pricing include?\nThe base model costs between $20,000 and $30,000. The shelter features an 11-foot ceiling, off-grid power, air conditioning, and dimmable LED track lighting alongside USB charging stations near the bed. The exterior is weather-resistant canvas, while the interior is made from Douglas fir.\nYou can add a solar package and a front porch\u2014which can also come with its own lighting\u2014which will measure 8-by-13 feet. A queen-sized mattress, frame, and headboard are also part of delivery, and everything is assembled in hours.\nA queen-sized frame, mattress, and headboard are included among a Jupe\u2019s standard features.\nWhat qualities make your prefab stand apart from the rest?\nI think what makes our prefab stand apart from the rest is its scalability. Right now we can make a Jupe in four hours, and we plan on being able to assemble one in just four minutes. Another detail that makes Jupe distinctive is its shipping efficiency. Our flat-pack model makes it possible to ship numerous Jupes at once, and we\u2019re in the process of developing a fleet model that can be deployed on shipping containers throughout the world.\nWhere is the prefab currently available?\nWe are currently available in North America.\n\"All you need to do is throw sheets on and you\u2019re ready to go,\" Wilson says of the setup process. A crew will come to assemble the Jupe in a matter of hours.\nIs your design currently pre-permitted in any U.S. municipalities?\nBecause of the way the Jupe is designed, we often don't need permits\u2014even in very strictly regulated places like Northern California.\nAre there plans to expand to different parts of the country and the world?\nWe\u2019ve shipped to about 20 different sites in the United States, and we have plans to expand worldwide. By this time next year, we want to be available on three continents, besides North America.\nA Jupe can be delivered and assembled within two weeks of deposit.\nHow long can a client expect the process to take after they put down a deposit?\nWe can have a Jupe up and running within two weeks of when a client puts down a deposit.\nWhat aspects of an install do you manage?\nWe manage all aspects of the install, and a crew is sent to the site to set up everything. There\u2019s almost no site prep, unless there\u2019s a significant slope. A Jupe can be up and running within hours.\nWhat aspects of the design can a client customize?\nYou can customize the color of the canvas, as well as details like HVAC options and whether you\u2019d like the Jupe to be entirely off the grid.\nPricing for a standard Jupe starts at $24,500, with additional costs for details like a front porch and off-grid capabilities.\nMore from Jupe:\nPrefab Startup Jupe Unveils a $17.5K Flat-Pack Shelter Inspired by \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"\nThis $5K Porta Potty Promises to Elevate the On-the-Go Bathroom Experience\nKelly Dawson\nContributor\nKelly Dawson is a writer in Los Angeles who has been contributing to Dwell's print and online publications since 2015.

This would make it easier to get shelter to people in need faster.\nWhat does your base model cost and what does that pricing include?\nThe base model costs between $20,000 and $30,000. The shelter features an 11-foot ceiling, off-grid power, air conditioning, and dimmable LED track lighting alongside USB charging stations near the bed. The exterior is weather-resistant canvas, while the interior is made from Douglas fir.\nYou can add a solar package and a front porch\u2014which can also come with its own lighting\u2014which will measure 8-by-13 feet. A queen-sized mattress, frame, and headboard are also part of delivery, and everything is assembled in hours.\nA queen-sized frame, mattress, and headboard are included in the Jupe's standard features.\nWhat qualities make your prefab stand apart from the rest?\nI think what makes our prefab stand apart from the rest is its scalability. Right now we can make a Jupe in four hours, and we plan on being able to assemble one in just four minutes. Another detail that makes Jupe distinctive is its shipping efficiency. Our flat-pack model makes it possible to ship numerous Jupes at once, and we\u2019re in the process of developing a fleet model that can be deployed on shipping containers throughout the world.\nWhere is the prefab currently available?\nWe are currently available in North America.\n\"All you need to do is throw sheets on and you're ready to go,\nSee the full story on Dwell.com: More Tent Than Cabin, Jupe\u2019s $25K Prefabs Don\u2019t Require Permitting\nRelated stories:\nYou Can Vanish Into the Woods With These $125K Mirrored Prefabs\nThese $220K Prefab Cabins Promise Steep Energy Savings\nThis California ADU Builder Minimizes Waste by Taking a Whole-Tree Approach\nView comments",

Here's what caught our eyes this week.\n'PROFESSOR DUMPSTER' ENTERS FIGHT AGAINST CORONAVIRUS\nJeff Wilson, founder of Austin-based Kasita, has launched a new venture that produces rapid-deployment recovery spaces for frontline health care workers and those needing to quarantine due to COVID-19.\nexpand\nJeff Wilson earned the nickname Professor Dumpster after living for a year in a converted dumpster, pictured, to test the limits of housing design and sustainability.\nKASITA\nWilson earned the nickname Professor Dumpster when he was on the faculty at Huston-Tillotson University and spent a year living in a converted dumpster to test the limits of housing design and sustainability. He later founded Kasita, once a buzzy Austin company that produced tiny homes, though it was reborn in 2019 under a new ownership group as a company that makes luxury hotel suites. At the time, the restructured Kasita's website said \"there was not enough consumer demand to support their plan to manufacture and sell tiny homes directly to consumers,\" leading Kasita in its original form to cease operations.\nWilson's new company, New York-based Jupe Inc., bills itself as a \"flat-packed housing startup built for crisis and disaster response,\" according to a March 26 announcement. Its latest product, Jupe Health, is designed to help hospitals deal with capacity issues in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The units are \"equipped with mobile bedding, technology, and amenities to support long-term containment efforts,\" according to the announcement.\n\u201cThe significant shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), equipment \u2014 like ventilators \u2014 combined with the massive cost of quickly building the infrastructure and managing a hospital bedroom, which is about $1 million per unit all-in, is a massive undertaking. Hospitals can\u2019t tackle it all rapidly enough, even once the federal government\u2019s aid package kicks in,\u201d said Dr. Esther Choo, chief medical advisor to Jupe Health.\nCOMPANY APOLOGIZES FOR 'ILL-ADVISED' PAY CUT\nOklahoma City-based ImageNet Consulting has shelved a plan to temporarily reduce employee pay in line with forthcoming federal stimulus checks.\nLast week the consulting firm, which has an Austin office off West Braker Lane, asked employees to acknowledge its new Employee Emergency Compensation Program, which requested that employees agree to a \"temporary compensation reduction that is in line with the assistance that it receives from the federal government related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\" A copy of the employee acknowledgement form was obtained by KXAN News.\nIn addition to a pay reduction equaling 100% of the government stimulus check, the plan also called for employee pay to be reduced by 50% \"of the government distribution for any dependent that the individual claims.\" The EECP would have continued if the government eventually extended its stimulus program.\nImageNet Consulting President Pat Russell sent a statement to KXAN on March 30 apologizing for the plan, adding that the company's intent was to \"serve the greater good and protect our most vulnerable employees\" by keeping as many people employed for as long as it could.\n\"However, we understand our plan was ill-advised,\" Russell added in the statement. \"We have rescinded the potential program, and we apologize for any pain or confusion it caused.\u201d\nRELATED CONTENT\nFour Austin startups confronting COVID-19\nRelated: Four Austin startups confronting COVID-19\nCoronavirus layoffs span all industries in Austin\nRelated: Coronavirus layoffs span all industries in Austin\nABOR: Governor's order allows Realtors to show properties again\nRelated: ABOR: Governor's order allows Realtors to show properties again\nBack to Top\nAUSTIN BUSINESS JOURNAL\nHome\nNews\nLists & Leads\nPeople\nCompanies\nEvents\nStore\nSUBSCRIBERS\nStart a Subscription\nSubscriber-Only Content\nDigital Edition\nBook of Lists\nBook of Lists - Unlimited\nManage your Account\nManage My Advertising\nSubscriber Content\nABOUT & CONTACT\nAbout Us\nAbout The Business Journals\nAdvertise\nHelp & FAQs\nCirculation Sales Center Directory\nAPPS & SYNDICATION\nMobile Apps\nSyndication/RSS\nFOLLOW US\ntwitter\nlinkedin\nfacebook\ninstagram\nNEWSLETTERS\nSign Up Now\nACBJ\nAmerican City Business Journals\nAmericanInno\nBizEquity\nBizLeads\nBizwomen\nHemmings\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nAd Choices\nSite Map\n\u00a9 2024 American City Business Journals.

The name, JUPE, is also a nickname used by astronauts to name Jupiter. These new kinds of tents do seem like they come from an other world. Designed by Jeff Wilson, a micro-habitat expert, these tents are destined to win over a new generation of nomads. The kind of people who make the outside world their home and live with the bare necessities. These people will now be able to set up their tent wherever they like without giving up on much appreciated comfort. JUPE is designed with upcycled materials integrating photovoltaic cells, it unfolds in just a few minutes, and includes a large-size bed. This new way of discovering new places will surely be one of the great trends of the years to come. Available this Spring, JUPE will be sold for \u20ac15,000.\nMORE WHAT\nSEE ALL\n15.07.24\n#DESTINATION\nRosewood Schloss Fuschl x Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: The Magic Hill\n09.07.24\n#DESTINATION\nLilou Hotel x David Pirone: A Foretaste of Hy\u00e8res\n02.07.24\n#DESTINATION\nH&M Home x Coqui Coqui: Seashells and Damask\nInstagram\nFacebook\nSW Agence\nContact us\nBook us\nRetrouvez tous les \u00e9v\u00e8nements et les rencontres qui ont marqu\u00e9 la semaine en exclusivit\u00e9 et avant tout le monde dans votre boite mail!\nNewsletter Sign-Up\nBy checking this box, you authorize us to send you our newsletter in accordance with our privacy policy.

Sam Gezari\nJupe is selling tiny prefab portable shelters.\nThe 111-square-foot pods were designed by ex-Tesla, Airbnb, and SpaceX employees.\nThey cost $17,500, and orders will start being fulfilled in March.\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\nAdvertisement\nTiny-living startup Jupe released new images of its sci-fi inspired portable shelters, or \"cosmos-inspired urban escape pods,\" late last year, and they're now available to preorder.\nThe company was founded by Jeff Wilson, an ex-IBM project manager known for living in a dumpster for a year and later creating the Kasita tiny home. With designers from Tesla, SpaceX, and Airbnb, Jupe is a portable prefab shelter that can go just about anywhere. Individual owners can bring their Jupe to remote locations for COVID-safe getaways, or Airbnb hosts could add additional units to properties with high demand.\n\"The desire to get out of the cities that we've seen over the past decade and the acceleration of that trend during the pandemic has drained short-term stay inventory for those that want to experience nature,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Further, the recent success of the IPOs in this space and the off-the-charts demand to 'stay close' make the timing for short-term stay products like Jupe impeccable.\"\nJupe is available for preorder for $99, with a total cost of $17,500. The company notes that the price is only about a fifth of the price of an average Airstream RV. Jupe will produce the units at its 10,000 square foot Los Angeles factory, beginning to fulfill orders by March.\nAdvertisement\nTake a look at the tiny prefab shelter here.\nAdvertisement\nJupe is made of interconnected aluminum masts that provide support for the geometric shape that's designed to be reminiscent of an \"interstellar shuttle.\"\nJupe urban escape pod.

Each unit is crafted from lightweight aluminum and comes fully equipped with all the amenities you need for a comfortable off-grid experience.

Plus, they come with smart home technology to make your off-grid living even more seamless and enjoyable.\nAfter raising approximately $1M in pre-seed funding and $3M during YC Demo Day, Jupe closed an additional $4.5M seed round led by Initialized Capital in late 2021, bringing their total funding to $9.5M. This investment will help them scale production, expand their team, and reach more people seeking sustainable living options.\nJupe is tapping into the growing demand for flexible, off-grid living options. Remote work, eco-tourism, and the tiny home movement all contribute to the appeal of their product. Additionally, Jupe's shelters have the potential to be a game-changer for disaster relief and refugee housing.\nWith a mission to democratize access to affordable, sustainable, and beautiful housing, Jupe has a bright future ahead.

Created by Cameron Blizzard, Jeff Wilson, and a team that included former employees of Tesla and SpaceX, the Jupe pod is a sustainable, compact, collapsible cabin that\u2019s adaptable to most terrain and leaves the ground and surroundings undisturbed while providing its inhabitants a great view with lots of privacy. Not only can it easily fit in the trunk of your car, but it can be assembled in only a few hours.\nAt 111 square feet with an 11-foot ceiling, there\u2019s plenty of space, and anyone is able to walk upright in the pod. The Jupe pod can fit a queen-size mattress and two end tables, and the unit also has hidden storage cubbies and a front-facing fa\u00e7ade that can open into a panoramic window. Staying in the Jupe pod does not prevent anyone from using electronics as it has solar energy and battery-powered electrical outlets and USB ports that provide excellent Wi-Fi access. Although it\u2019s not on the market yet, you can visit their website to preorder yours for $17,500.\nIf you want to travel in something more luxurious and spacious than the Jupe pod, the Bowlus Terra Firma camper may be perfect for you (above). The Terra Firma has overhead skylights, a Zen master bedroom, and an outdoor kitchen setup. It also has HEPA air filters, UVC lighting, and a water filtration system. Pets are not forgotten as the Terra Firma is equipped with a pull-out food tray for dogs (or cats). All of these amenities are powered by a lithium-iron-phosphate that can be managed through touchscreen controls.\nThe company Bowlus is named after Hawley Bowlus who was an aircraft engineer known for building Charles Lindbergh\u2019s Spirit of St. Louis in 1927. Bowlus soon after built his first trailer in 1934 to help transport flight crews to remote takeoff locations. Since then, the company has continued to produce the best in traveler trailers. Their trailers range from $190,000 to $265,000, with the Terra Firma being at the highest end of the spectrum.\nIf the Terra Firma appeals to you, but you can\u2019t afford the price, it\u2019s worth looking into trailers made by Airstream, a company that was inspired by Bowlus. Airstream has six different models to choose from that range from $39,500 to $161,900 and has gotten great reviews, including some from celebrity customers like Matthew McConaughey and Ralph Lauren.\nTo learn more about the Jupe pod and the Bowlus Terra Firma, and Airstream trailers, purchase Journal #369 at graphis.com.\nShare\nTweet\nRelated Articles\n0\n397\nWolfgang Puck Redesigned\n0\n555\nTazo Tea Inspired by Sandstrom Partners\n0\n495\nDelphine Hirasuna: The Art of Gaman\n0\n365\nF.A.

These are the details.\nHousing technology startup Jupe recently announced $9.5 million in seed funding led by Initialized Capital with participation from Y Combinator. The funding will be used to hire a CTO and a wider team of software and hard tech engineers and to execute its mission to make off-grid mobile living more affordable, faster, and efficient.\nSince launching in December 2020, Jupe made and shipped dozens of units to locations across California and Colorado. And Jupe is on a mission to make beautiful and dignified shelter instantly deployable onto any accessible piece of land.\nJupe\u2019s technology essentially allows an entire village of units to be deployed and broken down on remote terrain in a single day. Designed with flexibility and customization in mind, Jupes can redeploy and pop-up anywhere from music festivals to natural disaster areas for relief housing, and provide a fast alternative to any other kind of shelter and infrastructure for living.\nJupes are built on a unique \u201cchassis\u201d foundation \u2014 which gives them the flexibility to move quickly and freely and adapt to any terrain. And 15 fully off-grid, flat-packed units can be delivered on a single truck. Each unit arrives complete with a luxury queen mattress, linens and bed, furniture, LED lighting, solar panels, and backup batteries. Jupes assemble in just over an hour and units are ready to rent the day they arrive.\nThrough a short-stay-as-service (SSAAS) land partner program, landowners can activate their space via a software booking platform and install a village of Jupes. And Jupe will deliver, install, book, maintain and clean the units, while the landowner receives a portion of every night\u2019s rental.\nThe forthcoming SSAAS software platform will also help landowners manage, market, and book their inventory via other short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, Hipcamp, and booking.com.\nCEO Dr. Jeff Wilson, a former environmental science professor, spent a year living in a dumpster as a small space sustainability experiment. Wilson went on to found Kasita, an award-winning modular housing company that deployed accessory dwelling units (ADU) to backyards in California and Texas.\nAnd co-founder and COO Antonio Gonzalez, a former executive at unicorn hospitality startup OYO, also previously led a $100 million sprinter van conversion business while serving as a Presidentially appointed advisory board to the National Park Service. The early and current members of Jupe\u2019s team engineered structures on SpaceX\u2019s starship, designed solar panels and cars for Tesla, designed large cargo drones, founded travel app companies, and helped steer the brand at Airbnb.\nKEY QUOTES:\n\u201cModular construction is plagued with challenges around design, materials, and transport efficiency. I designed Jupe through learning what really works and what doesn\u2019t. Beyond creating a solution that scales the $4 billion glamping market, Jupe is a step forward in solving the housing crisis that impacts 1.6 billion people annually. Jupe units are ten times cheaper and faster to deploy than traditional temporary, mobile housing solutions, and ship 15 times more efficiently. On top of that, its unique design provides dignified lodging for everyone \u2013 with an internet connection.\u201d\n\u2014 CEO Dr. Jeff Wilson, former co-founder of award-winning modular maker Kasita\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to partner with Jeff and the team at Jupe. They are building a first-of-its-kind hard tech and software platform for the world. Jupe\u2019s vision of universal autonomous housing will ultimately allow anyone to live anywhere on the planet, comfortably and with an internet connection via satellite. It\u2019s something the world has been waiting for.\u201d\n\u2014 Initialized Capital founder and managing partner, Garry Tan\nPulse 2.0 focuses on business news, profiles, and deal flow coverage.\n\n  \u00a9 2024 Pulse 2.0 LLC.

GearJunkie may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article. Learn More\nBasically, the Jupe is a fancy, solar-powered yurt. But there\u2019s so much more to it than that.\nFor one thing, Jupe was engineered by designers from SpaceX and Tesla. Those design chops shine through in the aesthetics. For starters, the interior has a clean, minimalist look finished in birch, canvas, and aluminum. The exterior architecture is somewhere between a shipping container and a spaceship.\n(Photo/Jupe)\nComfort on Delivery\nJupe is designed to be livable upon delivery, so the unit ships with a queen mattress, bed frame with headboard, and a deck. Jupe doesn\u2019t need a foundation, so in most places that means it doesn\u2019t need a permit.\nAs a final touch, Jupe contains USB charging stations and outlets, and purchasers can add an optional porch, smart speaker, solar package, and exterior LED lighting.\n(Photo/Jupe)\nJupe (the company as opposed to the product) has an interesting business model, seemingly targeting people with 1) land and 2) an interest in breaking into the short-term rental game in a serious way.\nJupe partners with purchasers to drop off the units and help with renting and booking. The minimum number you can order is eight, so you do need lots of land and a lot of interest.\nPrices and partnership details are available upon request from Jupe\u2019s website. You can also book a stay in a Jupe in California, Colorado, or Texas.\nHidden Depths\nAll of this information is pretty much what\u2019s on the (somewhat sparse) website. But TechCrunch just interviewed Jupe\u2019s founder, Jeff Wilson, and the article reveals some surprising purpose behind the slick lifestyle photos and startup-standard web copy. Apparently, Wilson envisions Jupe as a solution to the global housing crisis.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not making fucking glamping tents for bros at Coachella,\u201d Wilson told TechCrunch in the interview. \u201cAt this point, food is a distribution problem, clothing is largely solved. There are about 1.5 billion people in the world that still don\u2019t have adequate shelter. If you\u2019re going to work on big problems here on earth, that\u2019s one worth working on.\u201d\nThat\u2019s enough of a dream to catch the attention of the Y Combinator, which TechCrunch is reporting just invested $9.5 million in the startup.\n(Photo/Jupe)\nWilson goes on to admit that the current iteration of Jupe isn\u2019t quite there yet:\n\u201cFor right now, it\u2019s someone that wants to have a very high-design, very comfortable experience in nature, off-grid. Longer-term as we build out the technology, we will build for people that no longer want to live in the cities, that want to live with a community of folks out on a raw piece of land. From there we expect to widen that time horizon to where people are living in these for weeks, months, ultimately their entire life.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a big dream and a worthy goal. We\u2019ll have to wait and see where Wilson and Jupe go from here.\n6 Unlikely 'Boosts' to Outdoor Innovation\nOne company turns cork into a weatherproof coat. Another product can be traced to the U.S. Army Ballistic Research Center. These six outdoor innovations have wacky histories.

        "content": "DESIGNED BY FORMER SPACEX, TESLA, & AIRBNB EMPLOYEES, THIS FLATPACK SHELTER IS THE ULTIMATE ADVENTURE ESSENTIAL!\n2021.12.24\nGlamping pods are cool but what if I tell you there is a portable shelter literally designed by the best in the game? Jupe is a luxe pod with a sci-fi-inspired design made by a team of multidisciplinary experts from across the housing, architecture, and engineering industries, including former SpaceX, Tesla, and AirBnB team members for modern travelers looking to escape their urban life and dive into nature. The glowing geometric structure and angular surfaces resemble a cut diamond or an interstellar shuttle more than age-old structures like RVs, cabins, tents, or yurts traditionally used for getaways.\n\nJupe is a portable off-grid shelter that flatpacks so you can pick any spot on the planet and pitch your tent. The futuristic silhouette is inspired by Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: Space Odyssey which explains the aluminum pole frame and glowing Firesist fabric exterior which also make it suitable to withstand different climate conditions. The mission was not to make a quick place to stay but to create a gateway to the outside world. It can be assembled in hours and gives you a 111-square foot space featuring tall ceilings, finished Baltic birch wood floors, a queen bed, and a storage area \u2013 think something right in the middle of a tiny home and glamping pod.\n\nThe large entryway doubles up as a window for your chosen scenery which you can endlessly gaze at from your queen-sized bed. The shelter also includes a 200 amp hour battery and solar array with electrical outlets, USB charging stations, dimmable LED lighting system, and a private wi-fi network if you cannot be completely off the grid. Apart from the bed, it is also furnished with designer pieces like the end tables, a desk + chair, an ottoman, and an average-sized monolith to stay aligned with the cosmos theme. Unlike most small portable shelters, Jupe\u2019s ceilings are 11 feet tall and cloaked in luminous Firesist fabric. Like most tiny homes Jupe also optimizes its space \u2013 the Baltic birch wood floors open up to individual storage cubbies totaling 38 cubic feet which is enough space to store ten large suitcases (in case you are on the run).\n\n\u201cExperiencing the natural wonders of the world shouldn\u2019t mean being forced to disconnect while staying in a less-than-inspirational living space,\u201d said Jeff Wilson, co-founder and CEO of Jupe. \u201cJupe is an out-of-this-city getaway inspired by out-of-this-world ideas. During these times when most of us are craving a true escape, Jupe provides an experience perfectly suited for socially distanced travel.\u201d The interior was designed in collaboration with renowned boutique hotelier Liz Lambert and sustainable architecture expert, TED Prize Winner, and former head of social innovation at AirBnB, Cameron Sinclair. Wilson, a design innovator and expert on modular housing, himself has lived in a 33-square-foot dwelling for a year and is known for founding the award-winning, micro-home Kasita.\n\nMobility is at the core of Jupe\u2019s design and hence chassis foundation has been created in a way that involves no decking or foundation to be built which makes the shelter adaptable to any terrain, level or not, and leaves the land minimally disturbed. Amenities in the shelter can be upgraded include a Sonos Move speaker integrated with Alexa capabilities, a locking safe, solar panels, and a porch. Jupe is an off-grid escape from the city, whether to the middle of a sprawling desert, a windswept cliff by the sea, or your own backyard.\n\nDesigner: Jeff Wilson\n\n-\n\n**Source: https://www.yankodesign.com/2020/12/24/designed-by-former-spacex-tesla-airbnb-employees-this-flatpack-shelter-is-the-ultimate-adventure-essential/\n\n**Author: CHI THUKRAL\n\n**Image Credit: Jeff Wilson\nSUBSCRIBE CONTACT US SITE MAP \u00a9Asia Designer Communication Platform.

Each unit arrives complete with a luxury queen mattress, linens and bed, furniture, LED lighting, solar panels and backup batteries. Jupes assemble in over an hour and units are ready to rent the day they arrive.\nThe company\u2019s technology allows an entire village of units to be deployed and broken down on remote terrain in a single day. Jupes can redeploy and pop-up anywhere from music festivals to natural disaster areas for relief housing, and provide a fast alternative to any other kind of shelter and infrastructure for living.\nSince launching in December 2020, Jupe has made and shipped dozens of units to locations across California and Colorado.\nThrough its short-stay-as-service (SSAAS) land partner program, landowners can activate their space via a software booking platform and install a village of Jupes. Jupe will deliver, install, book, maintain and clean the units, while the landowner receives a portion of every night\u2019s rental. The forthcoming SSAAS software platform will also help landowners manage, market and book their inventory via other short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, Hipcamp and booking.com.\nFinSMEs\n08/12/2021\nTAGSInitialized CapitalJupeY Combinator\nPrevious article\nSimplified Secures $8.5M in Seed Funding\nNext article\nThe Every Company Closes $175M Series C Funding Round\nRELATED ARTICLES\nUSA\nDiakonos Oncology Closes $11.4M Seed Financing\nUSA\nPrinciple Health Systems Acquires BioStat Imaging\nUSA\nEnigma Acquires Onclave Networks\nTHE DAILY NEWSLETTER - SIGNUP\nEmail address:\nContact\nAbout\nPrivacy Policy\nAdvertise with Us\nDisclaimer\nGDPR\nTerms & Conditions\nFollow Us\nSign-up now to the Daily Newsletter\n\u25b2",

Jupe founder Jeff Wilson has joked that the cabin\u2019s blueprints were beamed out from the last transmission of the 2001: A Space Odyssey monolith.\nPhotography: Sam Gezari\n1 OF 3\nAs well as its striking appearance, the pod offers a few extras that go beyond the most souped-up yurt. Its birch flooring lifts to reveal storage space for guests\u2019 belongings \u2013 including enough room for 10 suitcases \u2013 while solar panels and battery packs power WiFi and USB ports. Those that want to amp up the futuristic vibes can also request extras, including voice control.\nPhotography: Sam Gezari\nThe company says Jupe takes a few hours to assemble, with its raised foundation meaning it should work across various terrains. The cabins are available to pre-order, with a starting price tag of $17,500. Jupe expects to begin delivery in March 2021, and plans to tour some of the pods through California and Nevada.\nPhotography: Sam Gezari\nPhotography: Sam Gezari\nKodasema\u2019s Nordic tiny homes are now available in the USA\nTAGS: OFF-GRID LIVINGPODSTENTS\nMOST READ\n1\nBrasserie fare gets the gastropub treatment at Henri\n2\nEuro style and Swiss comfort elevate this mountain stay\n3\nSecluded modern Catskills home is located next to an Audubon Sanctuary\n4\nThis Lucerne dining room was an AI experiment\n5\nCornish church conversion near Tintagel castle has incredible views\n6\nThis new gallery in Kyoto is crafted like a ceramic vase\n7\nPalazzo Tal\u00eca could be Luca Guadagnino\u2019s most delightful project yet\n8\nAn elegantly restored Charles Du Bois mid-century home lists in LA\nMORE\nSHARE THIS STORY\nFacebook Twitter Save\nRELATED STORIES\nARCHITECTURE, TRAVEL\nA new off-grid rental sleeps four in the Californian desert\nARCHITECTURE, NEWS\nTwo maritime forts will go up for auction next month\nPROPERTY, TRAVEL\nBowlus launches its new \u2018flyweight\u2019 off-road trailer Rivet\nNEWS, PROPERTY\nAn off-grid house near Pioneertown, California, asks for $4.2m\nNEWSLETTER\nWANT NEWS DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX?\nSIGN UP\nLATEST\nThe Jupe pod is a sci-fi take on off-grid living\nInterior inspiration to kick-start your week\nBrasserie fare gets the gastropub treatment at Henri\nAn elegantly restored Charles Du Bois mid-century home lists in LA\nCornish church conversion near Tintagel castle has incredible views",

It has created three care facilities that can be flat-packed and rapidly deployed to hospitals in the US.\nJupe said that it could deploy 24 of the flat-packed units on a heavy-duty pick-up truck\n\"Hospitals can't tackle it all rapidly enough, even once the federal government's aid package kicks in,\" said Choo.\n\"The health system has many overlapping needs right now, and cannot function well without all the pieces in place,\" she continued. \"We're working to plug one of the more complex gaps.\"\nJupe Care is an off-grid recovery unit designed for patients that aren't critical\nThe facilities include Jupe Plus, a \"light\" intensive care unit (ICU); Jupe Care, an off-grid recovery unit for patients who aren't critical; and the Jupe Rest area that provides beds for medical professionals.\nJupe said it could deploy 24 of the flat-packed units on a heavy-duty pick-up truck with a 40-foot (12-metre) flatbed, or 500,000 on a single cargo ship, to both rural and urban areas in America.\n\"Having highly deployable recovery units gives us the best chance of fighting Covid-19 and to support our frontline medical professionals,\" Sinclair said.\nJupe Rest is intended to provide a place for medical professionals to sleep between shifts\nJupe has already started prototyping its Care and Rest Units. More details about Jupe Plus will be released next month, but the company says it will mark the \"world's first standalone intensive care unit\".\nJupe Rest units are designed to provide a place for medical professionals to sleep between shifts. It means that they don't need to travel back home, preventing contact with their families and avoiding spread of the Covid-19.\nRelated story\nCarlo Ratti Associati designs shipping-container intensive care units for coronavirus treatment\nEach comes with a bed and is connected to the Internet of Things, which refers to electronic objects that share data to provide a \"network-ready treatment space\" allowing air, climate and noise control.\nAlongside a bed, toilet, sink, and shower, Jupe Care units include ventilator hook-ups and separate chambers for medical professionals to don and doff protective equipment.\nThe flat-packed units have a faceted exterior that comes in either a soft or hard shell\nThe units are enclosed by a faceted exterior that is available in soft-top or hard covers, and are either solar or battery-powered and fitted with water-disposal.\nWilson said the project has brought together professionals from a wide variety of fields, including film, design and 3D-printing, and is unprecedented.\n\"Never before has a team of rocket-engineers, car-designers, architects, humanitarians, medical doctors, IOT-experts, and boutique hoteliers come together around a mission like this,\" he said.\nThe Rest modules can fit a range of beds\n\"Never before has the housing industry leveraged auto, space and software technology,\" Wilson added. \"Never before has the timing been more utterly critical than today.\"\nA number of architects, designers and companies have responded to coronavirus. Earlier this week, Italian architects Carlo Ratti and Italo Rota unveiled a proposal to create an intensive-care pod within a shipping container that could be added to hospitals.\nMajor brands have also responded to the medical equipment shortages caused by the pandemic, with car manufacturer Vauxhall and Gucci parent company Kering offering money and production lines to make items like masks, ventilators and hand sanitizers.\nRead more: Architecture USA flat-packed Coronavirus Intensive Care Units Jupe News\nSubscribe to our newsletters\nYour email address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare and comment\n8 comments\nMore\nArchitecture\nInteriors\nDesign\nTechnology\nLatest from Dezeen Showroom\nDots towel rail by Ludovica Serafini and Roberto Palomba for Tubes\nILE modular system by Foster + Partners for Benchmark\nBolete Lounge Bio seating by Patricia Urquiola for Andreu World\nAmsterdam tile collection by Realonda\nSamba dining chair by David Aguirre for Aguirre\nRoyal Twin coat stand by SoldiDesign\nFrida booth by Boss Design\nIn Out Office seating by Alfredo H\u00e4berli for Andreu World\nComments\nVisit our comments page | Read our comments policy\nTop architecture stories\nMost\npopular\nMost\nrecent\n1\nUniversity of Stuttgart uses self-shaping timber for garden show pavilions\n2\nTrace Architecture Office creates bookstore within historic academy\n3\nTen inventive contemporary houses in Austin\n4\nTen unusual Indian houses completed in the last two years\n5\nGiona Bierens de Haan Architectures refreshes Swiss mountain chalet\nThe venues set to host the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles\nPharrell Williams calls for architecture competition to return to Olympics at LA 2028\nHandel Architects completes \"the largest Passive House building in Canada\"\nMichael Green Architecture designs world's tallest mass-timber skyscraper\nSubscribe\nSubscribe to\nour newsletters\nYour email address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatrick Bradley Architects adapts ruins into house using shipping container\nJames Shaw's light-filled London home is almost entirely underground\nPopular\njobs\nFeatured\njobs\n1\nSenior BIM coordinator at Conran and Partners\n2\nPart 2 architectural assistant at Matt Architecture\n3\nAssistant/associate professor of landscape architecture at Harvard Graduate School of Design\n4\nPart 2 architectural assistants/Part 3 architects at Goldstein Heather Architecture\n5\nArchitect at Soda Studio\nAtelier Tao+C creates \"luminous\" bookshop in Chinese ski resort\nBeacon House extension by Office S&M features \"pillow-shaped\" tiles in bubblegum pink\nDezeen Events Guide\nDezeen Jobs\nHighlights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndonesian restaurant\n\n\n1970s doomsday bunker\n\n\nD-Day Museum\n\n\nUnusual Indian houses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\nComments\nSubmit a story\nAdvertise\nPrivacy notice\nContact\nSeries\nInterviews\nOpinion\nTalks\nVideos\nArchitecture\nInteriors\nDesign\nTechnology\nMagazine\nAwards\nJobs\nEvents Guide\nShowroom\nSchool Shows\nCourses",

We are also developing the worlds\u2019 first mobile off-grid and micro-grid capable ICU.\nWith industry experts on its advisory panel that includes Cameron Sinclair, chief humanitarian advisor to Jupe Health, who has previously co-founded the much-acclaimed Architecture for Humanity and Worldchanging; and Dr Esther Choo, an ER physician and health advocate who co-founded Equity Quotient, a company that conducts assessments of healthcare company culture.\nJupe Inc, a flat-packed housing startup built for crisis and disaster response, has announced JUPE Health, a rapid-deployment recovery space designed for healthcare workers and quarantined patients. As hospitals around the world brace for the future of the coronavirus, reaching capacity is one of the most critical issues healthcare workers face. Jupe Health aims to be an immediate response for a workforce that needs to stay near the hospital and for the anticipated flood of sick and recovering patients. These units are equipped with mobile bedding, technology, and amenities to support long-term containment efforts.\n\u201cHaving worked for decades in crisis situations, it is vital to put your health facilities where the epidemic is spreading. Having highly deployable recovery units gives us the best chance of fighting COVID-19 and to support our frontline medical professionals.\u201d \u2013 Cameron Sinclair, Chief Humanitarian Advisor, Jupe Health\nIt is a first-of-its-kind model, designed by both physicians and patients to optimize and increase care capacity. A patent-pending, internet-of-things enabled, all Jupe treatment spaces include a bed and are network-ready with air monitoring, climate control, and noise-reducing technologies.\nDesigned for easy mobility for the most vulnerable areas, Jupe Health can deploy up to 24 units with a single 40\u2019 flatbed and heavy-duty pickup truck to both rural and urban areas. Up to 500,000 can deploy on a single cargo ship. With hospitals being pushed to their limits, Jupe units provide a long-term solution to help ease and maintain surge capacity.\nYou might also like:\nCarlo Ratti Associati proposes modified shipping container ICU units to boost hospital capacity to deal with Covid-19 pandemic\nInterview: Thai architect Suvapat Chooduang of Supar Studio says poor natural and built environment practices affect quality of life in Bangkok\nCreative Crews discusses its award-winning classroom makeover for blind children in Thailand\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent a good part of my life thinking about the quantum leap needed to solve for what should be a basic human right: dignified housing. This leap will ultimately be about team, tech, and timing. Never before has a team of rocket-engineers, car-designers, architects, humanitarians, medical doctors, IOT-experts, and boutique hoteliers come together around a mission like this. Never before has the housing industry leveraged auto, space and software technology. Never before has the timing been more utterly critical than today.\u201d \u2013 Dr Jeff Wilson, CEO Jupe Health\nThis multidisciplinary team of ER doctors, designers, engineers, auto designers, product manufacturers, ICU physicians, IOT technologists, and patients have joined modular housing innovator Jeff Wilson (Jupe, Kasita), humanitarian designer Cameron Sinclair (Architecture for Humanity, Worldchanging), and health advocate and ER physician Dr Esther Choo (Equity Quotient) to launch JUPE Health and create modular temporary shelter and treatment units that are scalable, affordable, and transportable.\nThe firm aims to produce the first \u201crest\u201d and \u201ccare\u201d units for shipment in six weeks and plans to scale for mass production shortly thereafter. The units will be designed to meet the needs of the immediate crisis, but the firm also anticipates long-term repurposing for humanitarian relief for future disasters, homelessness, and displaced populations. It is currently developing Jupe Plus, the worlds\u2019 first off-grid and micro-grid capable ICU, allowing the most remote parts of the US to access to the greatest chance of survival.\nThrough dozens of co-design and research sessions, the firm has identified core healthcare needs, which include call rooms for doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff working around the clock who do not have the time or do not wish to return, and potentially infect their families while they care for Covid-19 patients; isolation rooms for patients diagnosed with Covid-19 who are stable but cannot return to their current living situation which includes patients from homeless shelters, psych units, group homes, nursing homes, domestic violence); regular hospital beds for patients with Covid-19 who need admission for therapy and monitoring; and intensive care unit rooms for the sickest patients \u2013 especially in non-metro and rural areas.\nThe firm is seeking institutional partners for the delivery of batches of 24 units and all-star players to help build the future of humane healthcare for those who need it most.\nARCHITECTURE FOR HUMANITYCAMERON SINCLAIRCOVID-19 PANDEMICEMERGENCY DESIGNHEALTHCARE ARCHITECTUREJUPE HEALTHMOBILE SHELTER ARCHITECTURE\nShare:\nStaff Writer\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE\nSandwiched between tall towers, this Shanghai hotel by Xing Design stands out for its bridge theme\nDecember 15, 2020\nPhiladelphia exhibition shines light on Japanese masters and their influence on American Mid-Century Modernism\nAugust 6, 2020\nWinners of Singapore Interior Design Awards 2021 honoured at gala ceremony\nDecember 19, 2021\nSUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER\n* indicates required\nName *\nEmail Address *\nCATEGORIES\nAdaptive reuse (37)\nArchitectural Photography (3)\nArchitecture (657)\nArt (44)\nAviation (3)\nAwards (11)\nBuilding Materials (44)\nCommunity architecture (62)\nCompetitions (27)\nCulture (43)\nDesign (97)\nEducation (57)\nEvents (74)\nExhibition (48)\nF&B (49)\nFashion (6)\nFeatured (752)\nFurniture design (41)\nHealthcare (13)\nHotel design (51)\nIndustrial design (23)\nInstallation (51)\nInteriors (153)\nInterviews (70)\nLandscape architecture (47)\nLeisure attraction (46)\nLifestyle (72)\nLighting Design (14)\nMuseums (22)\nOffice design (61)\nOpinion (4)\nPlaces of Worship (7)\nPublic Institution (55)\nResidential design (171)\nRestoration (6)\nRetail design (41)\nRural architecture (25)\nskyscraper (22)\nSmart Cities (6)\nSocial architecture (16)\nSports Complex (12)\nSurface design (10)\nSustainability (7)\nSustainable design (130)\nSustainable design (54)\nTransport (15)\nTravel (61)\nUncategorized (3)\nUrban design (80)\nWellness design (6)\nLATEST POSTS\nJean-Michel Gathy honoured with Outstanding Contribution at AHEAD hospitality design awards\nOctober 3, 2022\nSingapore Design Week Festival Director Mark Wee wants the world to explore the Lion City through a new creative lens\nSeptember 24, 2022\nInaugural FIND Design Fair Asia brings the best of global creativity to Singapore\nSeptember 22, 2022\nTAGS\nADAPTIVE REUSE ARCHITECTURE ARCHITECTURE EXHIBITION BOUTIQUE HOTELS BRICK ARCHITECTURE CHINA ARCHITECTURE COMMUNITY ARCHITECTURE CONCRETE IN ARCHITECTURE COVID-19 PANDEMIC DESIGN COMPETITION DUBAI ARCHITECTURE EDUCATION ARCHITECTURE EDUCATION DESIGN F&B DESIGN FOSTER + PARTNERS FURNITURE DESIGN HONG KONG ARCHITECTURE HOTEL DESIGN INDIA ARCHITECTURE INDONESIA ARCHITECTURE JAPAN ARCHITECTURE MALAYSIA ARCHITECTURE MUSEUM ARCHITECTURE NATIONAL DESIGN CENTRE NENDO OFFICE ARCHITECTURE OFFICE DESIGN RESIDENTIAL ARCHITECTURE RESIDENTIAL DESIGN RURAL ARCHITECTURE SEOUL ARCHITECTURE SHENZHEN ARCHITECTURE SINGAPORE ARCHITECTURE SINGAPORE DESIGNERS SOUTHEAST ASIA ARCHITECTURE SOUTH KOREA ARCHITECTURE SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE THAILAND ARCHITECTURE TIMBER ARCHITECTURE TROPICAL MODERNISM TROPICAL MODERNIST ARCHITECTURE URBAN REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY VIETNAM ARCHITECTURE VIETNAM HOUSES WOHA ARCHITECTS ZAHA HADID ARCHITECTS\n\u00a9 2023 - All Rights Reserved.",

Each Jupe unit is delivered as part of a chassis foundation that can be flat-packed to roam anywhere along with the onboard electrical grid. Two people can assemble the shelter in a few hours.\nJupe prefab shelter features one-of-its-kind modular chassis that houses wiring, electrical, and mechanical elements of a home into a flat packable foundation block. It is focused on modern travelers\u2019 who like to have a cozy home-like experience during trips. It works just like a tiny cabin perfect for short-term stays and even has modern facilities for a glamping experience.\nThis 111-square-foot tent is supported by aluminum masts and made using canvas. Its trapezoidal form and glowing frame are inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey. Inside, there is a queen-size bed, equipped with Nectar mattresses, a designer desk, chair, and ottoman. Baltic birch wood tile-flooring with plenty of storage makes the interiors more useful.\nJupe\u2019s clean interior was designed in collaboration with renowned boutique hotelier Liz Lambert (formerly Bunkhouse Hotels: El Cosmico, Phoenix Hotel) and sustainable architecture expert, TED Prize Winner, and former head of social innovation at AirBnB, Cameron Sinclair.\nJupe comes equipped with its own solar panel and 200 Ah battery system and Wi-Fi router, ensuring uninterrupted web connectivity for travelers. There are also options to include a Sonos Move speaker, a lock safe, a cooler, and a small porch.\nAlso Read: Boxabl Launches Casita Prefab Tiny Home That Sets Up in an Hour\nJupe units are now available for pre-order at a starting price of $17,500 through the official website.

Jupe\u2019s technology allows an entire village of units to be deployed and broken down on remote terrain in a single day. Designed with flexibility and customization in mind, Jupes can redeploy and pop-up anywhere from music festivals to natural disaster areas for relief housing, and provide a fast alternative to any other kind of shelter and infrastructure for living.\n\u201cModular construction is plagued with challenges around design, materials and transport efficiency. I designed Jupe through learning what really works and what doesn\u2019t,\u201d said CEO Dr. Jeff Wilson, former co-founder of award-winning modular maker Kasita. \u201cBeyond creating a solution that scales the $4 billion glamping market, Jupe is a step forward in solving the housing crisis that impacts 1.6 billion people annually. Jupe units are ten times cheaper and faster to deploy than traditional temporary, mobile housing solutions, and ship 15 times more efficiently. On top of that, its unique design provides dignified lodging for everyone \u2013 with an internet connection.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to partner with Jeff and the team at Jupe. They are building a first-of-its-kind hard tech and software platform for the world,\u201d said Initialized Capital founder and managing partner, Garry Tan. \u201cJupe\u2019s vision of universal autonomous housing will ultimately allow anyone to live anywhere on the planet, comfortably and with an internet connection via satellite. It\u2019s something the world has been waiting for.\u201d\nNews Desk\n+ posts\nHrNxt.com Newsdesk has researchers and writers with an excellent domain knowledge about the talent ecosystem, and the business environment.

And in a few hours, landowners will have a village of stunning, futuristic housing units.\nSounds like a dream, but\u2026\nAnytime you\u2019re building in PropTech, there are massive economic, technological, & executional challenges at play.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to break down the top 4 strategies Jeff is using to execute against his vision.\nOnto our 4 key takeaways \ud83d\ude0e \ud83d\udc47\nTakeaway #1\nIf it\u2019s capital-intensive to build, start with a premium Go-To-Market.\nJupe wants to bring high-quality affordable housing to the 1.5B people who live without a soft bed or a hard roof over their heads.\nIn the early days, Jupe won\u2019t have economies of scale to lower costs, nor widespread distribution to generate the revenues it needs to reinvest into R&D.\nSo it came up with a solution that can improve its profit margin with just a little more upfront investment in each unit\u2026\nGlamping \u2014 ie bougie camping.\nJupe\u2019s employing a premium Go-To-Market strategy \u2014 just like Uber & Tesla did in their early days.\nWith a few more amenities, it\u2019s making its units feel luxurious so that they\u2019re perfect for campers who fancy higher-end accommodations.\nAs a result, Jupe\u2019s being able to generate:\nHigher margins (so more profit to invest back into R&D)\nMore buzz (since customers are delighted by the experience so they spread the word to their friends)\nTakeaway #2\nHeavily incentivize suppliers in the early days of building a marketplace.\nHave you ever wondered why Uber & Lyft threw out crazy incentivizes for drivers when they were first starting out?\nBecause a marketplace is nothing without its suppliers \u2014 it has no service to offer.\nJupe incentivizes suppliers with a pretty sweet deal.\nLandowners want to earn revenue from their land, but don\u2019t want to face the hefty upfront costs required to build housing units.\nJupe\u2019s business model lets them monetize their land with no upfront costs. Here\u2019s how \ud83d\udc47\nThe landowner customizes their add-ons and requests the number of Jupes they want.\nJupe delivers & sets up the Jupes.\nJupe posts the units on Airbnb & rents them out.\nLandowner gets a revenue share without having to put in any effort.\nTakeaway #3\nMeet your users where they already are.\nBootstrapping distribution takes time.\nBut if you can identify where your users already go to complete the task at hand and then meet them there, you can acquire users quicker and be off to the races.\nJupe\u2019s taking a premium GTM approach by first focusing on the \u201cglamping\u201d use case \u2014 meaning its beachhead audience is people looking for short-term luxury camping rentals.\nWhere do these people currently go to book their rentals? \ud83e\udd14\nAirbnb.\nSo instead of waiting until Jupe\u2019s built up its own distribution, it\u2019s acquiring users by simply posting its listings on Airbnb!\nWhat can we learn from this?\nWhen you\u2019re trying to figure out where to get your first set of users, the first place to look might actually be your competitors\u2019 apps & websites.\nTakeaway #4\nRemote software updates can make hardware products more valuable over the long term.\nLet\u2019s take Eightsleep as an example. Would most people typically feel comfortable paying $3k for a normal mattress?\nProbably not, because before you know it, it\u2019ll feel outdated\u2026\nNew mattresses will come along and they\u2019ll have newer sleep technology. Over time, your mattress will feel less valuable to you relative to these new mattresses and you\u2019ll feel iffy about having paid the $3k.\nAn Eightsleep mattress is a whole other deal\u2026\nIt comes with software that automatically cools & heats the mattress and helps you track your sleep health.\nEightsleep regularly deploys new features & improvements to the mattress via remote software updates.\nThis makes its mattress more valuable over time, not less.\nQuite similarly, Jupe puts Raspberry Pis in its Jupes so that it can remotely push software updates with improvements and new IoT-powered features.\nWant to Learn More?\nIf you enjoyed this post, check out the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or YouTube.\nFor more startup stories like this in emerging verticals (Web3, HealthTech, FinTech, AI/ML), follow us on Twitter @TheBreakoutsPod and follow the makers of the pod: Akkshay Khoslaa & Gokul Kumarresen.\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\nFree\nDistraction-free reading.

Not everyone, though, has been caught off guard. The many scientists and analysts who have been advocating epidemiological preparedness over the past several years must feel vindicated (not to mention frustrated) right now. And then there are people like Cameron Sinclair, \u201ca social impact entrepreneur and humanitarian designer\u201d who many years ago founded the not-for-profit Architecture For Humanity. His past experience in conflict and disaster zones has given him some idea of what might come and a unique perspective on how to help deal with it.\nJupe Rest\n\u201cWhile most people are focused on today\u2019s issues,\u201d he wrote via e-mail recently from self-isolation in New York City, \u201ca team of us who worked in pandemic response have been looking at a near-future disaster [such as the current outbreak]. For the past two weeks, a multidisciplinary team has designed and developed rapidly deployable modular care and COVID-19 recovery/isolation rooms. We are also developing the world\u2019s first mobile off-grid/micro-grid capable ICU if COVID-19 hits rural [areas].\u201d\nJupe Xray\nThese mobile treatment and isolation rooms \u2014 developed by a start-up company called Jupe Health, for which Sinclair serves as chief humanitarian adviser \u2014 are about one-thirtieth the cost of hospital rooms and can be set up anywhere. Unlike big cities, where the mass mobilization of resources is easier to pull off, rural areas present numerous cost and logistical challenges when it comes to addressing outbreaks. The kind of overnight response that saw New York City, for instance, quickly transform its Jacob Javits Convention Center into a temporary 1,000-room disaster hospital (with considerable help from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) would have been next to impossible in a remoter upstate location.\nJupe modular bathroom\nJupe\u2019s mobile units, which are currently being tested in California, aim to resolve that problem. Designed by a team of healthcare professionals and mobile-shelter experts \u2014 Jupe\u2019s co-founders, Jeff Wilson and Cameron Blizzard, are a doctor and an equipment-leasing expert respectively, while Esther Choo, an emergency medicine physician and health services researcher based in Portland, Oregon, is the company\u2019s chief medical adviser \u2014 the units come in three variations: Jupe Rest, Jupe Care and Jupe Plus.\nJupe Rest, a climate-controlled self-isolation room and rest/sleeping unit for medical professionals, accommodates a king, queen or two twin beds, features air-monitoring and noise-reduction technology and is easy to sanitize after use, while Jupe Care, an off-grid recovery unit for non-critical COVID-19 patients, incorporates a donning and doffing chamber, includes a sink, toilet and ventilator hookups and comes with hard- or soft-top cover options.\nThe most ambitious of the modules, Jupe Plus, is billed as the world\u2019s first stand-alone micro-grid capable intensive care unit, intended to treat the severest cases. Like its \u201clighter\u201d counterpart, Jupe Care, it has a 20-square-metre footprint but is considerably more expensive ($99,000 U.S. and up, compared to $52,000 to $78,000 for Care, depending on configuration and hard/soft cover option). Jupe Rest, meanwhile, is roughly half their size (10 square metres, \u201cslightly smaller than a standard two-person dorm room\u201d) and ranges in price from $14,500 to $24,000, depending on configuration.\nJupe Double Red Cross\nJupe Double Cabin\nEach of the units, which are made at Jupe\u2019s facility in Texas, are mounted on individual platforms (two in the case of Jupe Care and Jupe Plus). Up to 10 of the Care units can be connected side by side to make a bigger treatment area.\nSo why not use tents, cruise ships or containers to treat COVID-19 cases as they materialize? According to Jupe, \u201cboats are virus traps, tents are inhumane and only one to two containers can be transported via truck at once.\u201d By contrast, Jupe\u2019s units can be transported 24 at a time via one truck.\nAt the moment, \u201cthe Jupe prototype team is set up near Redondo Beach [in California] and is building a few Rest units,\u201d Sinclair wrote recently on Facebook, adding that another block will shortly be available in El Paso, Texas. \u201cI\u2019m looking for any medical professionals who can test the units and give us feedback. Please tag anyone who might be able to help.\u201d\nA container for shipping Jupe units\nWhat 500,000 Jupe beds would like on a container ship\nThe need for such rapidly deployable treatment facilities, the Jupe team feels, is only to likely to grow in North America. \u201cWe will run out of ICU rooms and then need to decide who gets ventilators and support and who doesn\u2019t,\u201d says the firm, which is racing against the clock to make such choices moot.\nSHARE\nTwitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest,\nTAGS\nHealthcare\nJupe Health\u2019s Mobile Recovery Units Aim to Treat COVID-19 Anywhere\nCurrently being tested, the sophisticated care and containment modules are designed especially for rural and remote zones.\nWORDS\nDanny Sinopoli\nPOSTED\nMar 30, 2020\nSHARE\nTWITTER, FACEBOOK, LINKEDIN, PINTEREST, EMAIL\nDesign\nArchitecture\nInteriors\nCuriosity\nConference\nAZ Awards\nDesignlines\nAdvertise\nContact\nSpec Sheets\nJobs\nCompetitions\nEvents\nMagazine\nAZURE Shop\nSubscribe\nNewsletter\nInstagram\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nPinterest\nYouTube\nPrivacy Policy Terms of Use\n\u00a9 Azure Publishing 2024\nBuilt with \u2764 by Significant Other\nSUBMIT CONTENT",

The Jupe mobile shelters come in three distinct versions,\nJupe Rest\nThe Rest unit is equipped with beds for providing a place to rest and sleep for medical professionals working on the front lines and can also serves as a micro self-isolation room. The unit can fit a Queen or two twin XL beds and is Wi-Fi/network and IOT-ready, as well as off-grid or micro-grid capable. It also features air monitoring and noise reducing technology, Climate control, and an optional integrated filtration system.\nJupe Care\nThe Care unit is an off-grid solar power/battery-powered solution for non-critical COVID-19 patients. It features a donning and doffing chamber, Ventilator hookups, Toilet / sink / heat & A/C. The unit is negative pressure capable and also integrates sanitary black-water disposal as well as easy-access external pump/monitoring.\nJupe Plus\nThe Jupe Plus is essentially a self-contained Intensive Care Unit for those patients that require critical care, including readings for use with ventilators and specialized personal protective equipment. The company is calling it the Worlds\u2019 First Stand-Alone Micro-Grid Capable Intensive Care Unit.\nIn terms of mobility, Jupe says that its solution can be flat-packed and stacked for transport of up to 24 units at a time on a 40-foot flatbed trailer, towed by a heavy-duty pickup truck. It says it can load as many as 500,000 on just one cargo container ship for overseas transport, too. They use a common base or \u201cchassis\u201d and readily available materials, and the company says that one person can install a single unit in just \u201cminutes.\u201d\nThe Jupe units will sell for between $14,500 and $78,000 for the Rest and Care units respectively, with different configurations affecting the cost, and the Plus ICU units will be available for $99,000 and above. The shelters can be delivered to one location and later sanitized for delivery somewhere else, as such the company is considering a leasing model, though during this period they will be offering units at cost, with no margins, including cost of delivery.\nTAGS\nCORONAVIRUSCOVID 19FLAT PACKFLAT PACK BUILDINGFLAT PACK HOUSINGHEALTH AND SAFETYHEALTHCARE DESIGNHOSPITAL DESIGNHUMANITARIAN DESIGNJUPEMEDICAL FACILITY\nSHARE\nLivin Spaces\nAn online Architecture and Design platform publishing curated design content from Africa & other parts of the world.\nLeave a Reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Weiss\nDecember 22, 2020\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFlipboard\nLinkedIn\nWhile Jupe also envisions its shelters being set up farther into the wild, its photos show how they escape the city without going too far Jupe/Sam Gezari\nVIEW 9 IMAGES\nVIEW GALLERY - 9 IMAGES\nWhile 2020 has given the world serious cabin fever, it's also presented some compelling antidotes, from electric motorhomes to ultralight pickup campers. But sometimes the cure to cabin fever is, well ... a cabin, albeit one with a better view. The Jupe is something of a modern prefabricated cabin meant to drop and assemble anywhere, serving as a proper escape from everyday urban life. The radiant, low-fuss shelter plants temporary roots to deliver natural views and modern technological amenities you can't live without.\nCo-founded by Kasita founder and small-living guru Jeff Wilson, Jupe consists of a team with experience at SpaceX, Tesla and AirBnB. Fancying itself a \"high-design prefab shelter company,\" it imagines its unique temporary shelter finding use by the likes of landowners looking for a seasonal off-grid shelter solution or vacation properties in need of a temporary addition to handle overflow.\nMORE STORIES\nARCHITECTURE\nWasp-inspired setup 3D-prints complete homes for $1,000\nTINY HOUSES\nEasy-to-tow tiny house doubles down on space-saving design\n\"The desire to get out of the cities that we\u2019ve seen over the past decade, and the acceleration of that trend during the pandemic, has drained short-term stay inventory for those that want to experience nature,\" explains Wilson. \"The off-the-charts demand to \u2018stay close\u2019 make the timing for short-term stay products like Jupe impeccable.\"\nThe Jupe includes a dimmable LED lighting system that makes it glow softly at nightJupe/Sam Gezari\nThe Jupe shelter packs flat atop its foundation block for easier transport and builds up in a matter of hours, according to its creators. Jupe goes to great lengths to avoid traditional shapes like A-frames, boxes and domes in fashioning a frame-supported fabric shelter quite unlike those that have come before it. The result is a more obliquely angular and artistic monolith that Jupe describes as reminiscent of a cut diamond or interstellar shuttle. The shelter's skeletal aluminum frame members connect snugly by way of corner hubs, giving shape to the luminous, fire-resistant wall and ceiling fabric that glows under the night sky like a frosted lantern globe.\nInside, each Jupe comes with sleeping accommodations and other furniture Jupe/Sam Gezari\nInside, Jupe rolls out a 111-sq-ft (10.3-sq-m) floor below a ceiling that rises to 11 feet (3.4 m). That space comes partially filled by buyer's choice of single queen-size bed or dual twins topped with Nectar mattress(es). Also included are a desk, chair and ottoman. The floor itself is finished in Baltic birch wood tiling and provides home to 38 cu ft (1.1 cu m) worth of under-floor storage.\nThe large entryway serves as a particular highlight of Jupe's design, housing a full-height window designed to deliver postcard-worthy views. Face it at the prominent peak, city skyline, water body or prettiest part of your personal horizon and enjoy the view from the comfort of a cozy tent-like monolith cabin.\nThe large front window connects the Jupe with the views around it Jupe\nThe Jupe is intended as an escape from the trappings of everyday city life, but it's not meant to escape the bits that young, design-minded individuals don't want to leave behind. It comes prewired with an off-grid electrical system with 200-Ah battery, solar panel, and electrical and USB outlets. The LED lighting system that gives the shelter its ethereal glow is wired into that electrical system, as is the optional Wi-Fi router. Additional options include a Sonos Move speaker with Alexa voice support, a cooler and a front porch.\nJupe shelters are available for preorder now with a US$99 deposit on a $17,500 base price. The company is already building units at its Los Angeles manufacturing facility and timed the release of the first production model with December 21st's \"Great Conjunction\" event that saw Jupiter and Saturn appear closer together than they have in hundreds of years. It plans to ramp up mass production and deliveries in March 2021. It will also spend time in 2021 touring California and Nevada to showcase its design and features.\nSource: Jupe\nVIEW GALLERY - 9 IMAGES\nTAGS\nOUTDOORSPREFABRICATEDSHELTERGLAMPINGCABINSNEW ATLAS AUDIO\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFlipboard\nLinkedIn\n6 COMMENTS\nC.C.

Or is it more important to show how it looks next to a flock of birds?\npaul314 DECEMBER 23, 2020 02:29 PM\nThis looks as if it's designed to advertise to everyone else in the wilderness just how glamporous the owner is. Or maybe it's for glampers who get lost easily and need a big shining beacon to guide them home. Usually camping equipment is about maximizing how well you can see the nature around you.\nWB DECEMBER 23, 2020 04:10 PM\nfugly.... and the stacked rocks don't change that. Also nothing like a white glowing super thin-walled lighted up sign to every robber around....\nData Jack DECEMBER 24, 2020 09:34 AM\nI have to say, I agree with ArdisLille. 11 pics of the outside of the rig, and a few of the bed are quite worthless to people who enjoy learning about these facilities. In the interior shots, we see a bed, some trapdoors, and a pile of rocks. Is the a power source besides solar (30A, 50A, generator)? Kitchen facilities? Bathroom facilities? Dining capacity? Tank capacities? Water options (city? Tank only?) Pump type? Climate control? How is it transported? set up? Gross weight? Carrying capacity (lbs)?\nIt looks like it might be interesting, but we have been told almost nothing about it.\nBill S. DECEMBER 25, 2020 12:39 AM\nOh yeah, great idea being in that thing over looking downtown L.A. That\u2019s great if you have a death wish. $17,500 good luck with that\nBruce H. Anderson DECEMBER 26, 2020 03:40 PM\nSets up in a matter of hours?

Designed for modern travelers\u2019 quest to escape dense, urban areas for the wilds of nature, Jupe provides an out-of-this-world getaway experience. Each Jupe unit is shipped as part of a chassis foundation that can be flat-packed to roam anywhere, without regard to the electrical grid, and is assembled in hours.\n  The Jupe structure is supported by interconnected and durable aluminum masts which make up Jupe\u2019s illuminated and distinct geometric shape. Its simple assembly and chassis foundation make it adaptable to wherever one might wander, whether that\u2019s a sprawling desert, a crowded redwood forest, the shores of an isolated lake, or a windswept coastal community. Built as a work of art rather than a simple dwelling, Jupe\u2019s unique shape and angular surfaces resemble a cut diamond or an interstellar shuttle more than age-old structures like RVs, cabins, tents, or yurts traditionally used in nature getaways. \n  \u201cExperiencing the natural wonders of the world shouldn\u2019t mean being forced to disconnect while staying in a less-than-inspirational living space,\u201d said Jeff Wilson, co-founder and CEO of Jupe. \u201cJupe is an out-of-this-city getaway inspired by out-of-this-world ideas. During these times when most of us are craving a true escape, Jupe provides an experience perfectly suited for socially- distanced travel.\u201d\n  Each unit boasts cavernous ceiling heights of 11 feet, so users can comfortably maneuver when occupying it. Prioritizing small space with big impact, Jupe\u2019s 111-square-foot space is cloaked in a high-quality fire-resistant canvas soft-top and is grounded by finished Baltic birch wood tile-flooring. The floors open up to individual storage cubes totaling 38.1 cubic feet of storage, enough space to store ten large suitcases. Beyond a massive interior, side windows heighten the sense of openness, providing cross-ventilation and natural light. The unit\u2019s front-facing facade can open into a single large panoramic window to take in awe-inspiring wide-angle views. Splashes of warm desert tones enliven a minimal aesthetic that merges contemporary and functional design. Upon entering a Jupe, travelers are welcomed with a queen-size bed equipped with Nectar mattresses, a designer desk, chair and ottoman. \n  Jupe\u2019s clean interior was designed in collaboration with renowned boutique hotelier Liz Lambert (formerly Bunkhouse Hotels: El Cosmico, Phoenix Hotel) and sustainable architecture expert, TED Prize Winner, and former head of social innovation at AirBnB, Cameron Sinclair. \nJupe\u2019s ease of transport and high design makes it ideal for short term rental hosts looking to temporarily meet higher demand for their properties or for landowners looking to activate their space seasonally without grid connections, while being light on the Earth. \n  Jupe engineers have built a first-of-its-kind modular chassis that contains the wiring, electrical, and mechanical elements of a home into a flat- packable foundation block. Each Jupe comes tech-equipped with its own solar panel and 200 Ah battery system and WiFi router, ensuring travelers can enjoy the marvels of the natural landscape without sacrificing connectivity. Jupe units are also capable of utilizing solar panels, battery, and a panel system to power four electrical outlets and USB charging stations, an optional private wi-fi network, and dimmable LED lighting. Add-ons include a Sonos Move speaker with integrated Alexa capabilities, a lock safe, a cooler, and a small porch. \nJupe units are now available for $99 pre-order at a starting price point of $17,500, which equates to 1/5th the price of an average Airstream. The company has made the pods, which are manufactured in a Los Angeles factory, available for pre-order now, with the first flatpack kits due to be delivered in Spring 2021.\nCABINS\nCAMERON SINCLAIR\nJUPE\nLIZ LAMBERT\nRESIDENTIAL\nSPACE\nTENTS\nARCHITECTURE\nART\nDESIGN\nLIFESTYLE\nTECHNOLOGY\nurdesignmag is a daily updated web magazine that features captivating news from the creative world, covering spheres such as design, architecture, art, technology and fashion.\nCONTACT US\nADVERTISE\nPRIVACY & COOKIE POLICY\n\u00a9Copyrights 2024 urdesign\nAll material published remains the exclusive copyright of urdesignmag.

(Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nAt Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas an environmental science professor teaches sustainability by example, transforming an empty dumpster into a tiny apartment where he\u2019s lived for a year. Professor Jeff Wilson tells host Steve Curwood about life in his micro home and his long-term goals for Project Dumpster.\n\n\nTranscript\nCURWOOD: Oscar the Grouch lives in a trash can. So did Popeye the Sailor Man, but it\u2019s hardly the kind of home you\u2019d expect for a college professor. Yet Dr. Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, is teaching sustainability by downsizing his living quarters to the dimensions of a dumpster \u2013 a clean dumpster, mind you. Jeff Wilson joins me now from his steel abode on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, where he\u2019s Dean of the University College and teaches environmental science. Welcome to Living on Earth, Jeff, or, do you prefer, \u201cProfessor Dumpster?\u201d\nWILSON: I\u2019ll take Professor Dumpster and you\u2019re at my disposal.\nCURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Right now you're in your dumpster. What kind of headroom do you have?\nWILSON: Well, it's a standard 10 cubic yard dumpster, which means it's six foot by six foot at the base. And this one's actually quite tall; it's about seven feet.\n\nProfessor Jeff Wilson makes the most of his 36 square-foot tiny house. (Photo: Sarah\nNatsumi Moore)\nCURWOOD: I have to say, it doesn't sound like you're in a metal box. What creature comforts are there with you in dampening the acoustics?\nWILSON: Right. We're actually in the second phase of this experiment turning it into an average studio apartment. First of all, I've got a wooden false floor, so the actual height of standing room is about 6'2\" right now. I've got a window unit air conditioner. I have a few tapestries hanging on the wall. I have a twin bed and then a very small bookshelf on the corner with various things like an Oscar the Grouch mug and a Dr. Who Tardis.\nCURWOOD: You moved into your dumpster about a year ago. How come?\nWILSON: So the main point of this entire experiment is to test if one can have a pretty good life on a whole lot less. This is obviously an outlier, an extreme example of that. I've moved into 36 square feet, which is 1 percent the size of the average new American home today, so that\u2019s the ultimate goal of this. A lot of people asked why we used a dumpster instead of a tiny house or instead of even a container, and the reason we did that were some of the awareness and educational aspects of this project around addressing waste. And dumpsters, you know, are these magical boxes that we put our waste into and come back a few days later after a little bit of noise in the middle of the night, which I'm very aware of at this point, [LAUGHS] that garbage truck noise, and everything's disappeared. So we want to highlight some of those subjects as well.\n\nDr. Dumpster plans to amp up his sustainability project this winter by adding amenities such as a second story, solar panels and a composting toilet. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: By the way, what risk do run from, you know, the odd garbage truck seeing the dumpster and figuring maybe it'll dump you?\nWILSON: There is a bit of confusion, especially since all the dumpsters are still labeled no entry for humans. We have a few safety features, so that I'm not serviced. We have welded shut the front pockets, they usually pick up dumpsters with. And there also happens to be a weather station on this dumpster, so even the new guy hopefully won't mistake this dumpster for a normal trash dumpster.\nCURWOOD: Now, I'm looking at a drawing from your website entitled, \"Early thoughts on proposed designs.\" Let's see, there's solar panels, a sleeping loft, air-conditioning and heating, a water collection system, even a folding balcony. To what extent have you actually transformed that 36 square feet of metal into home sweet home?\n\nProfessor Wilson stands with his girlfriend Clara Benson outside his dumpster. (Photo: Sarah Natsumi Moore)\nWILSON: What we're going to do in this phase is try to make this into an average American home using normal appliances. So we're going to get a fairly normal toilet, shower head; we'll probably expand out a few of the walls to give us a little bit more space to do this. The spec that you're looking at is actually the third phase, what we call the \"uber\" dumpster, and in his phase we're going to use all the baseline data that we collected using the normal sort of stuff. In this third phase we're going to utilize solar and lower-flow type equipment so that we can hopefully get to 1 percent the usage of energy and water, and 1 percent the creation of waste of an average American home.\nCURWOOD: So what about Mother Nature? I mean, particularly what do you have in the way of plumbing?\nWILSON: This is a particularly difficult issue to deal with. Not only is it not a lot of fun urinating into a bottle when it's an emergency, or running to the nearest building in the middle of the night; it's also a problem in terms of design: dealing with waste in a healthy-type way, and also one that doesn't give off much of a fragrance in such a small space, but also by coding regulation. In Austin, it's currently not legal to have a composting toilet. What we are probably going to have to do is, you know, attach something to the outside of the dumpster or expand one of the walls and just capture that blackwater like in an RV.\n\nEgress from the dumpster can be challenging. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: So, your home, Professor Wilson, the dumpster, that is, is about 1 percent of the size of the average American home, and during your experimental year you're going to try to use only 1 percent of the water and energy of the typical home and generate only 1 percent of the average waste. So far, how's it going?\nWILSON: Well, we did quite well in the first phase because we weren't plugged into water or electricity for the first six months. The only issue is that it wasn't exactly that comfortable. When I'm moved in February we had three, what they call at least in Texas \"snow days\" meaning that it got below about 35 degrees, and generally the temperature in that phase inside, was the temperature outside. What we hope to do, not only looking at newer technologies for using less water and energy and things like solar, but also thinking a little bit more carefully about what sort of activities we use water and energy for. Most people, sort of, when they move to a smaller house,or move to a tiny home, one of the things they notice is that they spend a lot more time outdoors and a lot more time in the community. And one of the things we're interested in is the increased interactions with the community and the environment when you're in a smaller home like this, sort of what that might do for one's sort of quality-of-life and sense of experience and just the overall magic that is brought into the everyday. If you want to call it dumpster magic.\n[LAUGHS]\n\nProfessor Wilson\u2019s students peek in through the dumpster\u2019s \u201cwindow\u201d. (Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: Well, you certainly sound like a friendly guy, and I'm sure that you have friends, lovers, perhaps. So what kinds of guests do you have at your dumpster?\nWILSON: [LAUGHS] Well, I'll start with the latter one. I did have a girlfriend at the beginning of the experiment, and it seems that she is still around at least in the last coupleof days. And a lot of people do ask if you know this is the type of experiment that attracts the ladies, and I'll say that's a definite no. I do have frequent guests here; I don't stay in the dumpster when I have these guests\u2014and these are generally students or couch surfers. I've had people from several continents couch-surf in the dumpster; we\u2019ve got a very special guest on Thursday, I actually have the CEO of \u201ccouch-surfing\u201d itself, dumpster-surfing.\nCURWOOD: And as for your girlfriend so far she hasn't dumped you.\nWILSON: So to speak and I refrain from calling her a trashy chick.\nCURWOOD: Ooooh.\nWILSON: [LAUGHS]\nCURWOOD: So your goal for dumpster dwelling goes beyond just spending a year in a small space, it's all about educating through this project dumpster. So what do you hope to accomplish?\nWILSON: In the short-term, we've really got sort of a Zen, in the moment thing going on. We're looking to reach out to the public and reach out to our students for ideas such as ideas on this toilet. It's one of the biggest problems. I mean, the idea of a toilet, the pure ridiculousness of it\u2014that you've got to have this big piece of porcelain; you've got to have a whole sewage system. You've got to have a couple gallons of fresh water. These are some of the things that I think we're able to attack in a very small way. I mean, ultimately what this experiment is all about is not just can you be happy on a lot less, but I like to think of the dumpster as a conversation box, and as long as a conversation continues to go on, whether it be about sustainability, climate change, tiny homes or whether it be\u2014as some have suggested Obama's new housing plan\u2014as long as that conversation's going on and people are talking about it, I think we'll have accomplished our goal.\nCURWOOD: Professor Jeff Wilson teaches Environmental Studies at Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. Great talking to you from your dumpster. I hope you'll bring it to Boston and invite us for dinner, or maybe even a sleepover.\nWILSON: Hey, Boston or Austin, mi dumpster es tu casa, so just let me know next time you\u2019re around and when we're in Boston we'll drop by.\nCURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Thank you so much.\n  Links\nProject Dumpster\nHuston-Tillotson University on Professor Jeff Wilson\nWhat It\u2019s Like To Date a Guy Who Lives In a Dumpster\nMore on issues and obstacles faced by Professor Dumpster http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/09/the-simple-life-in-a-dumpster/379947/\n  Living on Earth wants to hear from you!\nLiving on Earth\n62 Calef Highway, Suite 212\nLee, NH 03861\nTelephone: 617-287-4121\nE-mail: comments@loe.org\nNewsletter [Click here]\nDonate to Living on Earth!\nLiving on Earth is an independent media program and relies entirely on contributions from listeners and institutions supporting public service.

How do we equip current and future generations with the tools they need for sustainable living practices? The Dumpster Project is investigating how you can transform an empty box into a happy, healthy home \u2014 healthy for you and the environment. The project also hopes to spark interest in the way that fun and forward-thinking innovation can help address the challenges facing both current and future generations as our world becomes increasingly complex.\n\nThe Dumpster Project is many things: a re-imagining of home, a portable learning initiative, a sustainability conversation, a creative branch of a wider green campus initiatives at Huston-Tillotson University (HT), a historically black institution located in the heart of East Austin, and, most importantly, an innovative STEM education platform that uses the real-world challenge of transforming a trash dumpster into a tiny sustainable home to inspire learners of all ages.\n\nMore About The Dumpster\nGraduating a New Class of Dumpster Residents\nPosted in - Dumpster Blog & FrontPage\non August 24th, 2015 0 Comments\nWe are pleased to have hosted five intrepid educators in our Dumpster home over the spring and summer.

The dumpster has got little but a mattress, A/C window unit, and a false floor under which he can keep his clothing and cooking equipment.\nThe backstory on Wilson\u2019s decision to begin the experiment is basically what you might expect, if you had to guess. As the Washington Post explained in its exit-interview with Wilson, after he moved out of his dumpster home: \n[H]e was living in a comfortable, 3,000-square-foot Brownsville, Tex., home with a large walk-in closet, an easily accessible bathroom and a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. He had a tenure-track professorship at a state university, an hour-long commute and a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\nToday, Wilson has none of those things \u2014 and insists that he\u2019s never been happier.\nBetween then and now, there was a divorce, a new job in a new city, a surrendering of worldly possessions, a new social arrangement with a new romantic partner and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 an olive green dumpster that he called home.\nWilson\u2019s stunt got lots of attention because the ideas behind Wilson\u2019s dumpster life are fashionable. The \u201cTiny Houses\u201d movement has picked up speed in the wake of the 2007-2008 recession. IKEA stores, perhaps in a nod to their European roots, make big shows of demonstrating how comfortable a two-hundred-square-foot living space can be. \nAccording to the FAQ on the Dumpster Project website, the focus of Wilson\u2019s year-long stunt was much bigger than just one professor: \nThis whole endeavor is way more than a weird professor living in a metal wastebasket. Beyond the obvious goal of creating one of the smallest sustainable living spaces on the planet, the project is heavily focused on engaging students and enhancing the Huston-Tillotson campus where it\u2019s located. Ultimately we\u2019re partnering with students to create a lively (and entertaining) discussion about what a good, sustainable life can look like and how to make that life available to more communities.\nAlthough Wilson\u2019s website may have noted that \u201cif all goes well, Professor Dumpster has stated that he is not opposed to taking up permanent residence in his dumpster dwelling,\u201d he\u2019s out of it now\u2014and of course he\u2019s on to his next project. \nThe new social experiment or whatever it is that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin. Pretty self-explanatory, really. According to the new project\u2019s website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime\u2014right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\nPOPULAR VIDEOS\nPrevious\nNext\nThe Best Mexico City Street Tacos in Austin\n0 seconds of 22 seconds\nMORE\nThe Best Mexico City Street Tacos in Austin\nThe Story: Writer Katy Vine on \"The Positively True Adventures of the Kilgore Rangerette\u2013Kidnapping Mom\"\nLet\u2019s just quickly acknowledge the irony that a guy whose famously minimalist lifestyle included \u201ceight or nine bowties\u201d is now mocking hipster trappings like music festivals and craft-beer tastings. Okay, moving on, his project appears to be a bit of Morgan Spurlock-like first-person investigation: Wilson will sleep on couches to see a variety of ways that people in Austin live, with a photographer and writer in tow to document the experience. He is also seeking sponsors.\nBut how revelatory can 99 Nights ATX really be? The project will limit him to a self-selected group of homes by its nature\u2014he can only go where he\u2019s invited, obviously\u2014and it\u2019s unclear why he needs sponsors for something that will have him sleeping rent-free in other people\u2019s living rooms, though it seems mostly harmless. (update: after this post went live, Wilson removed the \u201cpartners\u201d link from the 99 Nights ATX website; the page is cached here.)\nStill, if your reaction to all of Wilson\u2019s projects is that something feels off, well, you\u2019re not alone. Most stories about Wilson feature commentary from readers who take issue with the fact that he\u2019s becoming a minor celebrity through these gimmicks, and that\u2019s understandable. \nThere are already people who live in dumpsters without A/C units or garden gnomes or eight to nine bowties, of course\u2014it\u2019s just that they\u2019re homeless. They\u2019re unlikely to end up enjoying media attention from \u201cThe Atlantic, MSNBC, NPR, BBC, HuffPo, USA Today, CNET, Fast Company, The Guardian,The Weather Channel, Al Jazeera & 200+ others,\u201d as the page on his 99 Nights website boasts. They don\u2019t get sponsorship opportunities at all, and they\u2019re unlikely to be able to parlay their experience into a book deal, something Wilson told the Washington Post was on his agenda.\nSimilarly, there are a lot of people who sleep on couches whose \u201csocial experiment\u201d is based on having nowhere else to go. The National Coalition for the Homeless reports that an estimated 1.65 percent of the population is \u201ccouch-homeless,\u201d or people who have no permanent residence but stay with friends or family. In Dallas youth shelter Promise House claimed in 2008 that roughly one thousand homeless teenagers in the city are \u201csofa-surfers\u201d (full disclosure: my mother-in-law is the former executive director of Promise House). In the UK, sofa-surfing homelessness is an issue getting serious attention as part of a campaign to consider the mostly-invisible homeless population.\nWilson\u2019s website talked about sustainability and furthering the availability of sustainable living to more communities, but his own project was buoyed by extensive corporate sponsorship from Ford and Freescale as well as other corporations, and a pair of local hipster home outfitting retailers interested in being associated with Wilson\u2019s impressive media reach. (If any of these sponsors want to invest in things that benefit people in need of low-cost sustainable housing, we might suggest a few other worthy causes.)\nAlso, living in a dumpster is also actually illegal, unless you happen to own the dumpster in question. (Wilson was able to secure permission to occupy his particular dumpster from the university.)\nNone of that makes the fun, quirky \u201cexperiments\u201d that Wilson is performing wrong, but it does make them kind of obtuse. Wilson\u2019s experiments are fundamentally about homelessness\u2014you don\u2019t move into a dumpster unaware of the association\u2014but when he talks about \u201cWhat does home look like in a world of ten billion people\u201d by celebrating the gimmicks behind what he\u2019s doing, there\u2019s an important thing he\u2019s missing: for many people, it just looks a lot like living in a f#%$ing dumpster.  \nWe certainly don\u2019t wish Wilson ill as he brings his bowties into 99 different people\u2019s homes, but it\u2019s hard not to see these projects as very interesting ways for the guy to get on television and in magazines, creating opportunities for corporate partners to co-brand #DumpsterLife or #CouchSurfing as a quirky way to challenge middle-class conceptions of how we live. But if the majority of the time we spend talking about people who live in dumpsters or on other people\u2019s couches involves a university professor on the hunt for a book deal, we\u2019re not creating an interesting dialogue. We\u2019re avoiding one. \n(AP Photo/Austin American-Statesman, Laura Skelding.)\nHome\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nEmail a link to this page\nComments\n0\nShow More\nRECOMMENDED\nSTYLE & DESIGN\n\u201cGranny Flats\u201d Could Remake the Housing Market.

Eventually, he hopes to turn his new home into a full-on \u201cspace capsule in a trash can\u201d with WiFi, air conditioning, an Xbox and other modern luxuries. The yearlong class experiment, called The Dumpster Project, is out to prove that people can live in a lot less space but still have a rich\u2014if not richer\u2014life.\nWho did you consult with for the project?\nI recruited a world-class team that includes one of the top green designers in the world, one of the top water energy experts and people in the STEM education community. They\u2019re acting as an advisory board. But the students do the real design and thought-process work on this.\nWhy a dumpster and not some other small space?\nYou get a very shocking reaction when you tell people at a cocktail party that you\u2019re living in a dumpster. They don\u2019t say, \u201cThat\u2019s great. The weather tomorrow looks terrible.\u201d The experiment fuels a very long conversation within and between groups that don\u2019t traditionally talk about issues of living with less and sustainability.\nAny thoughts on how this will affect your personal life?\nMy mom is a Martha Stewart\u2013type and very concerned about image. If someone brings it up at her bridge club, it pokes her a little bit, but I think she secretly likes it. My girlfriend has always known [about the project]. I think once I actually move in, it will become difficult. I\u2019m on campus, so there are visitation hours.\nWill you be entertaining in your new place?\nOh yeah. We\u2019re going to have a dumpster-warming party when I move in. I want to have a couple of chairs out in the yard and a little back porch. It\u2019s one of the best views in Austin. A thousand-dollar home with a million-dollar view.\nPopular Articles\nWhy Is Austin Dating So Cursed?\nA Major Developer\u2019s Collapse Leaves Abandoned Projects Scattered Across Austin\nThe 25 Best Tacos in Austin\n50 Great Dates in Austin\n6 Texas Beaches Just a Short Drive From Austin\nWhat\u2019s With All These Breakups in Austin?\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nCurrent Issue\nArchives\nTRENDING NOW\n1907\u2019s Chill Summer, and Other Austin Weather Records That Might Surprise You\nThe Highland Lakes Are Rising Again!

Wilson is documenting his progress on the website dumpsterproject.org, using videos and social media to showcase his sustainable living project.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just to explore the idea of less,\u201d he told ABC station KTRK in Houston.\nProfessor Goes Green: He\u2019ll Live in Dumpster for a Year\nStudents, who helped clean the dumpster before Wilson moved in, were stunned when he announced his plan.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at all,\u201d student Charles Deshaw said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re really going to live in a dumpster?\u2019\u201d\nJeff Wilson is using a dumpster as his home at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Tx.\nThe front door slides shut. It\u2019s cold at nights. The walls contain decorative hangings. The home features few appliances such as a washer and dryer, which were added during the current phase of his project. The third and final phase will feature solar panels with a focus on renewable energy.\nFor Wilson -- who goes by the nickname \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d -- the second night in the dumpster was scariest.\n\u201cThe trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors,\u201d Wilson told KTRK.\nLuckily, Wilson\u2019s new home remained untouched by trash crews. After living in the dumpster for six months, Wilson is proud of the discourse his experiment has encouraged and that it has promoted the idea of living with less.\nIt\u2019s important to \u201cfoster a conversation and keep that conversation going. We don\u2019t know where that conversation is going to lead,\u201d Wilson told KTRK.\nTrending Reader Picks\nHigh school QB dies after suffering brain injury\nAug 26, 8:08 AM\nBody of endangered man believed to have been found\nAug 27, 5:29 AM\nYou might not want to rush to get new COVID shot\nAug 26, 11:25 PM\n4-year-old stabbed multiple times in NJ home\nAug 25, 9:29 PM\nPilot who tried to shut down engines shares story\nAug 23, 6:10 PM\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events\nABC News Network\nAbout Nielsen Measurement\nChildren's Online Privacy Policy\nContact Us\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nInterest-Based Ads\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nYour US State Privacy Rights\n\u00a9 2024 ABC News",

His startup Kasita makes 352-square-foot smart tiny homes that are packed to the brim with technology and storage space. He\u2019s showing off a Kasita model home at the 2017 South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas.\n\u201cWe\u2019re solving a very old, complex problem,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cReal estate is thousands of years old. Land is where old wealthy families store all their money. So it\u2019s a very locked down system. So what we say is where is where are the cracks in the system?\u201d\nCurrent U.S. homeownership rates have dropped to a historical low, mostly because millennials aren\u2019t buying houses. Saddled by college debt and rising home prices, many can\u2019t save up to make the downpayment on market-value houses. Wages aren\u2019t increasing and cities are building new housing to meet demand, Wilson adds. At $139,000 a unit \u2014 which works out to a mortgage of about $800 a month plus land lease costs, according to Wilson \u2014 he thinks many more people can afford to call a Kasita home.\nWilson was previously a professor of environmental science at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. In 2014, he decided to see how much space people really needed to live comfortably. He sold most of his possessions, found a 6 foot X 5.5 foot dumpster, placed it on the university campus, and moved in with his few favorite items, including a handful of books and a few shirts.\n\u201cIt was absolutely insane,\u201d Wilson admitted. \u201cI just wanted to try it for an experiment, what happens when you push the absolute limits of small and base level.\u201d\n\u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d lived in his repurposed home for about one year, save a few nights when he was traveling or staying with friends. But even though he learned ways to make the space seem larger like painting the walls white and creative storage hacks, there were still some things he couldn\u2019t fix. Architects and engineers couldn\u2019t figure out how to fit a kitchen and bathroom inside the dumpster. He resorted to using the dorm and school gym bathrooms.\nJeff Wilson lived in a dumpster for about one year to see if he could downsize into a tiny space.Courtesy of Molly Mandell\nWhat Wilson learned was while 33 square feet might be too small, people could definitely downsize their living space in order to have more disposable income for traveling and other experiences. However, a house had to feel like a home and not make the person give up any conveniences.\nSure, Kasita\u2019s are tiny at first glance. But, they come with ultra-modern amenities like Amazon Alexa-powered lighting modes and dynamic windows that have programmable tint modes, as well as a clever design that maximizes its space while giving you tons of storage options. For example, a small staircase can be pulled out like a dresser, while the queen-sized bed completely tucks under the kitchen floor when not in use.\n\u201cThis is a 12,000-pound piece of hardware filled with software,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Internet of Things are really useful until it becomes the Internet of experience.\u201d\nThe pods are portable with a crane, and can be placed anywhere. Wilson sees a future where people can rent spaces on parking structures or stack Kasita\u2019s in premium spaces to take advantage of great location.\nAnd, Wilson is embracing the small lifestyle permanently. After SXSW, he plans to move into into the model Kasita with his partner. He\u2019s downsized his possessions even more. He\u2019s down to one shirt.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you caught me on the day after I dry cleaned it,\u201d he joked.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore In South by Southwest\nFormer Speaker John Boehner on weed legalization: It\u2019s time for Washington to \u2018get out of the way\u2019\nThomas Franck\nMore than 8,000 electric scooters have taken over SXSW in Austin this year\nSalvador Rodriguez\n03:34\nScooters have taken over South By Southwest\nDain Evans\nREAD MORE\nStay in the loop\nGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inbox\nSIGN UP\nAbout Us\nLearn more about the world of CNBC Make It\nLEARN MORE\nFollow Us\nCNBC.COM\nJoin the CNBC Panel\n\u00a9 2024 CNBC LLC.

Wilson, college dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is highlighted for his daring challenge to live inside of a 33-square-foot trash container. It\u2019s all part of the Dumpster Project, an experiment he\u2019s developing with students to build a \u201clow-impact, zero-net-waste\u201d dwelling out of the trash container.\nIt was interesting to learn about how many items of convenience Wilson has stripped from his life to place himself basically in solitary confinement: He\u2019s got no toilet or shower (he uses the university\u2019s), no washer and dryer for his clothes (he uses the laundromat), and his wardrobe is reduced to a few pairs of pants and shirts, three hats, and \u201ceight or nine\u201d bowties.\nIt\u2019s basically a crib \u2014 though when finally complete, it will be something that could possibly revive MTV Cribs. Here\u2019s what it will look like:\n  This was not mentioned in the story, but his school, Huston-Tillotson, is a historically black university. The student group Hamblin does mention, Green is the New Black, is the Huston-Tillotson student organization that is driving the Dumpster Project, and it is holding its inaugural Building Green Justice Forum on campus on Sept. 25.\nHuston-Tillotson is spotlighted in the a report I just wrote about that highlights environmental work and progress at historically black schools. In particular Huston-Tillotson gets props for its Dumpster 101 curriculum, based on this project, and also its off-campus activity, like the STEM program it\u2019s created for K-12 classes. It\u2019s kinda criminal that this university didn\u2019t make the Sierra Club\u2019s or Princeton\u2019s \u201cgreenest schools\u201d lists based on this dumpster-ology alone.\nWhich brings me to another item left out of the story: That East Austin, where Wilson\u2019s dumpster home and the university are located, is an area where African Americans and Latinos have historically lived segregated from the rest of the city. This racial segregation is by design, which you can read about in Cecilia Balli\u2019s Texas Monthly story, or Luke Winkie\u2019s in Vice. It\u2019s part of why Austin is considered the 10th most segregated city in the nation.\nEast Austin is showing signs of gentrification, however. And Wilson himself could be easily taken for one of those caricatured-too-much hipsters encroaching upon black territory. He\u2019s white. He has \u201ceight or nine bowties.\u201d But his Dumpster story charts a different path.\nThe lack of space in Wilson\u2019s pod has pushed him into more intimate contact with his neighbors. As noted in the story:\nHe spent a lot more time out in the community, just walking around. \u201cI almost feel like East Austin is my home and backyard,\u201c he said. He is constantly thinking about what sorts of things a person really needs in a house, and what can be more communal.\n\u201cWhat if everybody had to go to some sort of laundromat?\u201d Wilson posited. \u201cHow would that shift how we have to, or get to, interact with others? I know I have met a much wider circle of people just from going to laundromats and wandering around outside of the dumpster when I would\u2019ve been in there if I had a large flat screen and a La-Z Boy.\u201d \u2026\nHe\u2019s also welcoming of anyone who wants to stop by the dumpster and talk sustainability any time. \u2026 On some nights, Wilson will stay with a friend, and students from the ecology-focused campus group Green Is the New Black will get a night to stay in the dumpster.\nOne of the biggest gripes about gentrification is that the invasive species moving in often seclude themselves from the natives, throwing off community chemistry. But Wilson\u2019s dumpster is not a white sanctuary among black residents. Community is part of his intention. Also, since his place of rest is not a house, his occupation has not lead to someone else\u2019s displacement, another prime feature of gentrification.\nNow obviously we can\u2019t all live in dumpsters to avoid pushing people out of their homes. But I like the kind of thinking that Wilson\u2019s dumpster model hopefully inspires: How can we get in front of the problems often created in the gentrifying process? One way is not to ignore race, but rather to purposefully engage  it.\nA message from   \nAll donations matched for a limited time!\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Professor Dumpster, in his bid to become part of the 'new 1%' will strive to use 1% the water, 1% the energy, and create 1% the waste of the average American home,\" reads The Dumpster Project website.\nWe first came across Wilson over at The Atlantic, where they describe his downsizing from a 2,500-square-foot house to a 500-square-foot apartment and finally to the 36-square-foot dumpster. For reference, that's 152 square feet less than the self-proclaimed \"world's smallest house\" in London, 204 square feet less than a typical $30,000 tiny house, and 92 square feet smaller than the tiny house in which a Business Insider reporter spent the weekend with her mom.\nAdvertisement\nWe were so intrigued by Wilson's project that we reached out to Team Dumpster to see if it had photos to share. We've published them here with the group's permission.\nAdvertisement\nThe Dumpster Project will be completed in three phases, starting when Wilson took occupancy in February 2014: camping in a bare-bones dumpster (shown here); living in a dumpster \"home,\" with additions such as storage and a bed; and then fine-tuning the dumpster into the ultimate sustainable home.\nSarah Natsumi Moore / The Dumpster Project\nEarlier in stage two, the project's current stage, a fake floor was installed to store Wilson's belongings and limited wardrobe.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nAdvertisement\nLater in this stage, the dumpster will be hooked up to electricity and water. Measurements will be taken of how much of these resources Wilson requires to be comfortable.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nNow, the dumpster is starting to look a little more like home.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nAdvertisement\nHere, you can see its garden beds, mailbox, and sole window.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nWilson told The Atlantic that in the summer, his Texan dumpster can easily top 100 degrees, making it unbearable during the day. Luckily, he can take refuge in his office. Until an exterior composting toilet and shower are installed, he will continue relying on the university's facilities.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nAdvertisement\nThis photo was taken from the dumpster's sole window, which also functions as the door.\nSarah Natsumi Moore / The Dumpster Project\nThis shot from the \"skylight,\" \"retractable roof,\" or \"lid,\" depending on what you want to call it, gives a pretty good idea of the dumpster's dimensions.\nSarah Natsumi Moore / The Dumpster Project\nAdvertisement\nIn the third and final stage, which hasn't yet begun, the team will continue adding to the home with a focus on making sure it uses 1% of the energy and water used in of the average American home.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nNow for a very different kind of home ...\nLiz Calvi\nThese Powerful Photos Depict The Reality Of A Generation Of 'Lost Boys' \u00bb\nLibby Kane, CFEI\nExecutive Editor, Personal Finance Insider\nLibby Kane is a personal finance expert who has reported and edited stories about money for more than 10 years.

Wilson wanted to rethink the resources used by a typical single-family home, and dumpsters happen to be about 1% of the size of the average new American house. He also likes the symbolism.\n\n\u201cDumpsters are ubiquitous, yet unseen,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re these magic boxes where you throw what you don\u2019t want and it disappears. I think they\u2019re representative of our actions on a daily basis\u2013when you flip on a light switch, about the only impact you might see is a little bit of change in cost. But there are all of these things happening behind the scenes.\u201d\nHe also wanted to take advantage of people\u2019s visceral reaction to trash to get them to pay attention. \u201cIt\u2019s taking the whole idea of home and mixing it with one of the most powerful reactionary forces in the human psyche, that of disgust,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to engage people these days on issues of sustainability because people just largely have become numb to it, and it\u2019s become boring. Especially if that\u2019s not your thing.\u201d\nSubscribe to the Compass Newsletter.Fast Company's trending stories delivered to you daily\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nFast Company Newsletters\nThe oddity of the dumpster house has drawn in an audience that otherwise probably would not be talking about sustainable design. He was featured on a recent episode of a conservative radio show, for instance. Though the hosts opened the show by framing Wilson as \u201ca hipster who\u2019s had too many PBRs,\u201d they ended up expressing support for the project.\n\u201cHow many times do you get a conservative talk show saying they love a project that has undercurrents of sustainability?\u201d Wilson asks. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have even called me if I wasn\u2019t living in a dumpster.\u201d\nOver the next half of the year, Wilson and a team of students will set up the dumpster like a miniature version of a typical American home, complete with air conditioning. Basically, the goal is measure \u201cbad\u201d performance in a tiny home. In December, they\u2019ll begin to remodel it with every conceivable sustainable feature, from solar power to a cutting-edge green toilet.\n\nUltimately, the team will use what they learn from remodeling the dumpster to make plans for a small house that others can build themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take all of the lessons we\u2019ve learned from this about design and living in small spaces and we\u2019re going to build the tiniest home to code in the city of Austin,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cWe want to develop a \u2018how to\u2019 for building the tiniest home possible.\u201d\nWhen Co.Exist last spoke to Wilson last October, he was preparing to begin his experiment. So far, Wilson says he hasn\u2019t had any regrets about the decision to give up his ordinary house, despite the fact that garbage trucks wake him up in the middle of the night when they empty the dumpsters next to him, and summer heat will likely be a challenge. \u201cThe experience of having such a small space and no distractions when you go home has been interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd my commute to work is now a two-minute walk.\u201d\nThe Dumpster Project is currently raising funds on Kickstarter.\nApply to the Most Innovative Companies Awards and be recognized as an organization driving the world forward through innovation.

This is relevant to the story only because New Line Cinema bought the rights to turn that story into a rom-com.\nIn 2014, Wilson moved into a dumpster behind the women\u2019s dormitory at Huston-Tillotson University in East Austin. Over the past year, Wilson converted the dumpster into a tiny home, complete with air conditioning \u2014 it is Austin, after all \u2014 as well as the full support of the university where he is both professor and dean of the University College. A student group, Green Is the New Black, helped him with his project and slept in the dumpster on nights when Wilson elected to sleep elsewhere.\nThis is where people, including me, begin to project their own emotions onto the story: why did he pick the dumpster behind the women\u2019s dorm? Why do I feel weird about students sleeping over in their professor\u2019s living space, even if he isn\u2019t there? How does Wilson balance dumpster life with parenting his elementary-school-aged daughter? (Wilson is divorced and it appears that his ex-wife has primary custody of their daughter.)\nAnd here\u2019s one new emotion that I just picked up this morning: why did none of the Professor Dumpster articles that I read over the past year, not until the Washington Post profile I read today, mention that Huston-Tillotson University is an Historically Black College? If there are students of color who helped Professor Dumpster build his dumpster house, their faces should have been photographed next to his, alongside his bow tie and his Stetson.\nBut we don\u2019t have to worry about any of that anymore, because Professor Dumpster is moving out of the dumpster \u2014 and if you live in Austin, he might be coming to a couch near you.\nAs the Texas Monthly reports, in an article titled \u201cWhy Professor Dumpster\u2019s Gimmicks are a Bunch of Trash:\u201d\nThe new social experiment or whatever that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin \u2014 pretty self explanatory, really. According to the new project\u2019s website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime \u2014 right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\nYes, Professor Dumpster is going couchsurfing. (Hat tip to Billfold commenter Josh for sending us the Texas Monthly link.) The Texas Monthly notes that he\u2019s also looking for project funding \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s unclear why he needs sponsors for something that will have him sleeping rent-free in other people\u2019s living rooms\u201d \u2014 but when I follow the link to his 99 Nights ATX sponsor page it looks like he\u2019s actually looking for corporate sponsors, which probably has more to do with raising the profile of his experiment than crowdfunding his couchsurfing.\nHere\u2019s how 99 Nights ATX describes the project:\nJeff will spend 99 nights in 99 different homes gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their inner spaces. Sarah Natsumi Moore, an established Austin photographer, will document the journey with her camera and Clara Bensen, a local writer, will compile short stories to accompany each home.\nWe will learn a lot about the former Professor Dumpster and his team by the people he chooses to stay with and the stories his team chooses to tell about them.\nAfter all, it\u2019s pretty clear what story I\u2019m choosing to tell about Professor Dumpster.\nPhoto credit: PhotoAtelier\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\nFree\nDistraction-free reading.

He\u2019s an environmental science professor at Huston-Tillotson University (HTU) AND a dean!\nI had to meet him when I flew into Austin for a board meeting earlier this month.\nWhat\u2019s his story?\nHe\u2019s the test variable in his own research, exploring the boundaries of conventional living options.\nCan one live in a space of 36-square feet?\nThe first half of the year, he endured sparse amenities, sponge baths at a sink in one of the university\u2019s bathrooms, and sub-freezing nights. The second half of the year, he added some creature comforts with air conditioning and a futon bed.\nAs a professor, he inspires by example. His students remain curious about sustainability in their own lives. He welcomes teachers to spend a night through his Dumpster Project \u201cHome\u201d School residency program. (Scroll to \u201cEducation Programs\u201d in the PDF that opens.) His DumpterProject.org even offers educational opportunities for 5th and 7th grade science\u2014helping young people understand sustainability of water, food, and energy.\nWhat unfolded was quite unexpected.\nWe met for breakfast on a rainy morning at a small neighborhood restaurant two miles east of the Capitol.\nDonning a professorial corduroy sport coat over a plaid shirt with bowtie, and heavy black-framed glasses topped with a Stetson will catch anyone\u2019s attention!  That adventurous mix caught mine.\nHe is letting go.\nHe picked up the tab for breakfast. I objected since I had invited him to meet with me. He explained that\u2019s what the money is for\u2014to let it go. Although, he\u2019s not giving away money, he is testing many of the conventions of day-to-day living we often take for granted.\nHe just sold his car the evening before we met, choosing to get around town on an electric bicycle or on foot.\nAfter breakfast, we walked to the University to see the Dumpster. I looked inside and took a few pictures. (It had just been painted.) We went to his office to continue our discussion.\nWhat is he trying to prove?\nHe\u2019s asked this question, frequently. Anytime, anyone endeavors to do something that defies convention, amateur psychologists gather to decode the pioneer\u2019s psyche by delving into the past.\nWas it something from his childhood?\n I was curious about his childhood. He recalls trying to arrange Legos in ways that reflect principles of feng shui. He remembers most horizontal surfaces filled with stuff. In STUFFology 101, there\u2019s a reference to tilting horizontal surfaces to prevent the accumulation of POOP (Piles of Overwhelming Paperwork).\nA past relationship?\nHe was married once, but his ex-wife\u2019s and his relationship went their separate ways, amicably.\nPast profession?\nAfter a stint with Ernst & Young, he quit, because in the real world, it seems no matter how stellar one\u2019s results, there\u2019s always a leader wants things done a certain way.\nSometimes, people do things for reasons we\u2019re unable to understand.\nHe\u2019s not trying to change our behavior.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to do anything.\u201d He doesn\u2019t expect the world\u2019s population to live in dumpsters. Although, a dumpster would be desirable shelter for billions who live in poverty.\nHe\u2019s not even trying to prove a point.\n\u201cI\u2019m just doing my own thing.\u201d He\u2019s stretching the boundaries of how we choose to live while exploring sustainable options. He\u2019s conducting \u201cradical personal experiments that have the potential to make a ripple in society.\u201d He\u2019s \u201cinspired by people who sell their home, buy an RV, and travel. It\u2019s a freeing feeling.\u201d\nWhy a Dumpster?\n\u201cThe dumpster is a metaphor for the dichotomy between our sacred space (where we live) and the waste we throw away. The crap we don\u2019t want disappears when we toss it in a dumpster.\u201d Bringing together such disparate elements \u201cserves as a symbol and a surprise.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next?\nHis goal is to explore \u201chow to build a beautiful home for the price of a car payment in the middle of a city.\u201d\nHis research is inspiring. His experiments are lessons in letting go while letting in the world of adventure through sustainable living. He inspires a growing community of us with greater awareness of the cumulative global impact of our feature-rich lifestyles.\nBy letting go of things we often think are necessary, he has created a life of freedom, flexibility, and fun. For example, he and his girlfriend/writer, Clara Bensen, completed several trips to different countries around the world without any baggage. Read more on his Wikipedia page.\nI hope he doesn\u2019t let go of the gift of STUFFology 101: Get Your Mind out of the Clutter, I was happy to sign for him.\n  Tags: Letting go, piles of overwhelming paperwork, POOP, Professor Dumpster, STUFFology 101 book\nYou might also like\n1\nREPLY\nEric Riddle STUFFologist\nApril 23, 2015 at 8:56 am\nWow, talk about letting go of stuff!\nThere is some pretty cool information as you click through the various links. I liked the video overview of The Dumpster Project, very matter of fact approach. For me it is compelling because he does not preach, but just explains what he is doing and offers examples of possible benefits of his research project.\nIt definitely makes me consider how much less stuff I can live with!\nComments are closed.\nRECENT POSTS\nThe Future of STUFFology 101\nDo Something In 2022\nWe NEED Your HELP \u2013 Please Read and Comment\nUnexpected Gifts for Christmas\nDeclutter Tug-of-War with Past, Present, and Future\nRECENT COMMENTS\nMiguel Mayorga on Declutter Tug-of-War with Past, Present, and Future\nEric Riddle STUFFologist on Nostalgia\u2014Fondness for Times Past\nLeslie A Boyle on Nostalgia\u2014Fondness for Times Past\nBrenda Avadian on Kids, Cats, and Clutter\nBrenda Avadian STUFFologist on \u201cWhen I get rid of this stuff, then I will\u2026 \u201c\nARCHIVES\nJanuary 2022\nDecember 2021\nNovember 2021\nOctober 2021\nSeptember 2021\nAugust 2021\nJuly 2021\nJune 2021\nMay 2021\nApril 2021\nMarch 2021\nFebruary 2021\nJanuary 2021\nDecember 2020\nNovember 2020\nJanuary 2019\nDecember 2016\nApril 2016\nFebruary 2016\nNovember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nAugust 2015\nJuly 2015\nJune 2015\nMay 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nJanuary 2015\nDecember 2014\nNovember 2014\nAugust 2014\nJune 2014\nApril 2014\nMarch 2014\nCATEGORIES\n2 Magic Questions\nCluttergories\nDe-Clutter\nDigital Stuff\nFUN Stuff\nNews 'n Views\nReviews\nS.T.U.F.F.\nUnexpected Gifts",

This is a question best pondered, it seems, from the inside of a Dumpster \u2013 which is why Jeff Wilson, a dean and associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University, decided to move into one this past February. It seemed the perfect testing ground for the theory that \"less is more.\" Wilson intends to stay there one year, during which time \u2013 assuming all goes well with a $100,000 Kickstarter campaign ending July 1 \u2013 he and students will transform the Dumpster into a \"sustainable house and interactive teaching lab\" that uses only \"1% of the water, energy, and space of the average American home.\" As Wilson likes to say, \"It's the new one percent.\"\nAccording to the current design proposal on Kickstarter, the Dumpster's final stage of transformation (\"Phase 3: Space Capsule \u00dcber Dumpster\") will feature a \"pop-up\" second story, sleeping loft, \"folding balcony,\" composting toilet, solar shower, and rooftop rain collection system. For portability, it will tuck back together into its original form like George Jetson's briefcase. The whole experiment will be accessible \"in real time\" thanks to \"dumpster cams and a data feed with current dumpster conditions.\"\nFinal plans for a livable Dumpster (Image courtesy of Jeff Wilson)\nCurrent Dumpster conditions for now are more modest and mosquito-ridden \u2013 though, as Wilson notes, \"What's nice about a 33-square-foot house is you can just net the whole thing.\" While he's become adept at leaping through the Dumpster's side window, he provides guests with a repurposed swimming-pool ladder. Inside, all appears clean, thanks to a vigorous run through a \"car wash on steroids\" at the Texas Disposal Systems' facility. None\u00adthe\u00adless, says Wilson, \"My girlfriend swears she can still smell a hint of barbecue. Maybe we got lucky and got a Dumpster from behind Franklin's Bar\u00adbecue.\" Art by Wilson's 6-year-old daughter adorns the walls, solar-powered gadgets charge his iPhone and track indoor temperature, and raised floor panels hide clothes stored underneath. At night, he sleeps on a Kazakh mat. Being an inch taller than the Dumpster is wide, he lies diagonally across the six-by-six-foot space (along the hypotenuse, in professor language). In the mornings, he makes Turkish coffee and tends his garden with water lugged by foot from Lady Bird Lake.\nThere is also a considerable element of theatre. Notably, Wilson does these things while donning the role of his bespectacled, bow tie-clad alter ego, \"Professor Dump\u00adster.\" With an affinity for pithy bons mots and puns (his email signature is \"at your disposal\"), Wilson has infused the project with a winking irreverence. His move-in during February's long cold spell drew news coverage from as far away as the UK, which suggests that the Dumpster is precisely the \"conversation box\" it's intended to be. The Professor also appeals to students. In the spring, Blackshear Ele\u00adment\u00adary School fifth graders joined in to test soil, filter water, and build garden beds. At year's end, Professor Dumpster spoke at the students' graduation. This kind of hands-on learning is particularly meaningful, says Blackshear Principal Betty Jen\u00adkins, and it builds much-needed college awareness.\nAmanda Masino, an HT assistant professor of biology, helps develop \"experiential, design-based, and inquiry-based\" curricula around the project, using \"the same challenge but modifying it based on grade level,\" she says. A Dumpster 101 class brings HT students into the project, which is generating lessons beyond simply tracking energy and water use. Students will be analyzing DNA swabbed from the Dump\u00adster's interior, for example, and sampling Wilson's blood to track his stress levels. There are also policy issues to be explored, such as the limits building codes impose on design.\nThe project has significance for students beyond the classroom. Last fall, they thought it was \"strange\" when Wilson proposed living in a Dumpster, says sophomore Angelica Erazo, but they rallied around the sustainability idea. \"We decided to come up with an organization to help push that issue, as well as create environmental awareness in the Eastside community,\" she says. Erazo co-founded Green Is the New Black, a student group promoting a campuswide initiative to reduce water and energy use. The organization recently won $10,000 from Home Depot in the Retool Your School challenge. The group is also focused on bringing minorities into the environmental conversations of which, Erazo notes, they've often been left out. Because affordability is a major part of that conversation for low-income communities, she hopes to clear up the misconception that being environmentally friendly has to be expensive. \"You can save money being green,\" she says, pointing to simple behaviors like turning off the lights.\nThe Dumpster Project is not one of those money-saving endeavors \u2013 at least not yet. While the point right now is to bring the brightest designers and best technological expertise to the experiment, says Wilson, affordability is central to the ultimate goal of developing a sustainable model of living. \"This may be a $100,000 Dumpster home,\" says Wilson, \"but the next project might be the tiniest house built to code, and the next could be a tiny home for under $20,000.\"\nGot something to say on the subject?

For \u201cThe Ultimate Conversation Box: A Dumpster,\u201d Dr. Wilson will be describing how he links his academic research, teaching, and community activism with issues of sustainability as well as with his role as a dean at Huston-Tillotson University. Wilson will also give a \u201ctour\u201d of his dumpster/home.\nHere\u2019s what a recent piece in The Atlantic had to say about him:\nProfessor Wilson went to the dumpster not just because he wished to live deliberately, and not just to teach his students about the environmental impacts of day-to-day life, and not just to gradually transform the dumpster into \u201cthe most thoughtfully-designed, tiniest home ever constructed.\u201d Wilson\u2019s reasons are a tapestry of these things.\n[\u2026]\nNot long ago, Wilson was nesting in a 2,500 square foot house. After going through a divorce (\u201cnothing related to the dumpster,\u201d he told me, unsolicited), he spun into the archetypal downsizing of a newly minted bachelor. He moved into a 500-square-foot apartment. Then he began selling clothes and furniture on Facebook for almost nothing. Now he says almost everything he owns is in his 36-square-foot dumpster, which is sanctioned and supported by the university as part of an ongoing sustainability-focused experiment called The Dumpster Project. \u201cWe could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d Wilson said at the launch, \u201c[fueled by] sunlight and surface water, and people could have a pretty good life.\u201d\n[\u2026]\nFor Professor Dumpster, the undertaking is at once grand and diminutive, selfless and introspective, silly and gravely important, even dark. \u201cWe bring everything into the home these days,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to leave the home for anything, even grocery shopping, anymore. What\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home.\u201d\n\u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I had before.\u201d\nThe talk will take place Friday, September 26 at 4:30 in Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s AL Auditorium at 900 Chicon Street.\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Department of American Studies, the Graduate Program in Community and Regional Planning, and Plan II Honors. We hope to see you there.\nShare:\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\nRelated\nPost-Game Analysis: Senior Cole Wilson on Dr. Chris Newfield and the Future of Higher Education\nMay 6, 2016\nIn \"public scholarship\"\nAnnouncement: Dr. Julia Mickenberg Comments on Civil Rights History in Life and Letters\nApril 8, 2014\nIn \"Announcements\"\nFive Questions with First Years Continues: An Interview with Kristen Wilson\nOctober 29, 2018\nThis entry was posted in Announcements and tagged activism, Austin, dumpster, environment, HBCU, sustainability.\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Announcement: Deborah Willis Lecture This Thursday\nAlumni Voices: Carly Kocurek \u2192\nLeave a comment\nAMS :: ATX is a blog dedicated to representing the many activities and interests of the department of American Studies at The University of Texas at Austin.

An environmental science professor is making a 33-square-foot dumpster his new home for the next year.\nHis name is Dr. Jeff Wilson, but since embarking on this journey, he's now going by Professor Dumpster.\nHe teaches at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, and received his Ph.D. from Harvard.\nThe goal is to embrace energy efficiency, and to prove that it is possible to live on a smaller scale - a much smaller scale.\nThis whole project revolves around using one percent of what an average American uses: one percent of the water, energy and waste.\nDr. Jeff Wilson checks out his new 33 square foot dumpster home. (Credit: @profdumpster/Instagram)\n\"We really needed some sort of excitement around science, sustainability and technology,\" says Wilson.\nHe says the idea came to him over two years ago. Since then he's been recruiting a world-class team of professors, scientists and environmentalists to make his idea a reality.\n\"My hypothesis is that my life will be better,\" Wilson says. \"I'll be fulfilling a richer life by living a smaller life.\"\nLast night was the first night in his new home. Wilson says that in this phase of the project, the only thing he has to keep him warm during the cold Texas nights is his sleeping bag.\nHe's embracing the simplicity, and welcoming the changes that will come in the next year of the project. Instead of being strapped down to expensive monthly rent, he'll be a homeowner with his mortgage paid off.\nBut dumpster living comes with challenges, like walking a mile down the hill to the town lake for water.\nThe outlook is positive, though. Wilson says in six months he hopes to have things like an air conditioner and an X-box. A shower, a toilet and even WiFi is in the works, too.\nDr. Wilson has a whole team behind him, including a student organization called Green is the New Black. He says team members can even volunteer to spend the night in the dumpster and give him the night off. As the project progresses, the team will be fundraising for low-energy appliances and electronics, and will monitor the energy used on the team's blog.\nHe'll be taking his dumpster home to local elementary schools and sharing his project with the students. It gives the students the opportunity to give him design ideas and ask questions. One of the most pressing so far: \"How is Santa going to get in?\"\nTo follow Dr. Wilson and his team's journey through dumpster living, check out the blog at dumpsterproject.org.\nABC News Network Privacy Policy Your US State Privacy Rights Children's Online Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads Terms of Use Do Not Sell My Info Contact Us \u00a9 2024 ABC News Internet Ventures.

Don\u2019t they know that goes in the recycling?\nWilson is one of those energetic college professors who students will remember for the rest of their lives, thanks to his imagination and creativity. Along with thinking outside the box, he\u2019ll be living in it. Truth is, students retain what their entertaining teachers tell them.\n\u201cNobody wants to hear another lecture about how the world is going to be destroyed if everybody doesn\u2019t drive a Prius,\u201d said Wilson, a seventh-generation Texan who did his postdoctoral work at Harvard University. \u201cWhat we want to do is have a party and have everybody come to the party.\u201d\nThe point of the dumpster experiment is to show that people can live with less. Wilson points out that he will be staying in a space that is a mere 1 percent the size of an average American home.\nSome of Wilson\u2019s students formed a group called Green Is The New Black and won a green-oriented student competition in Dearborn, Mich., that landed Huston-Tillotson a $75,000 grant from the Ford Foundation. Most of the money will be used for scholarships, but $20,000 of it will go to Professor Dumpster\u2019s Dumpster Project, dumpsterproject.org.\nThe dumpster, which Wilson hopes to move into by February, will be cozy. When ready, it will be set up on a concrete slab poured for the project on the Huston-Tillotson campus, at East Seventh and Chicon streets.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the same size as this booth, maybe a little bit smaller,\u201d Wilson said, as we ate lunch in a restaurant near downtown. \u201cIt\u2019s six by six.\u201d Forget about stretching out. \u201cI\u2019ll fit in there at an angle,\u201d Wilson added. Actually, the Dumpster Project will use two dumpsters provided by Texas Disposal Systems \u2014 one for Wilson\u2019s living arrangements and one to conduct environmental experiments in Wilson\u2019s Dumpster 101 lab.\n\u201cSomebody said it was a cross between Bill Nye (the Science Guy), Thoreau and Oscar the Grouch,\u201d Wilson said.\nWilson\u2019s students are pumped. \u201cI think he deserves some sort of plaque or something,\u201d said Olivia Sanchez, a Huston-Tillotson senior majoring in biology with a concentration on environmental science.\nWilson\u2019s year in a dumpster will run through various stages.\nDuring the first stage, Wilson will rough it. \u201cDumpster camping,\u201d he calls it. It will be him and four metal walls, and that\u2019s it. Although he will have the dumpster scrubbed for nasties before he climbs in the side door. The dumpster cleaning will provide another teaching opportunity.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to show the kids blown-up microscopic images of what was in the dumpster before Professor Dumpster moved into it as a home,\u201d he said.\nHey Doc, what\u2019s for lunch?\n\u201cI want to do an urban forage and not buy anything at H-E-B,\u201d said Professor Dumpster, who plans to do a bit of dumpster diving during the early going.\nAs time goes on, the dumpster will be tricked out with some of the amenities of a middle-class home. Wilson plans to install a solar panel, a little composting toilet, even a shower behind the Dumpster. \u201cAll of the stuff to make it a normal American home instead of a trash can,\u201d Wilson said.\n\u201cI was trying to get a Sleep Number bed,\u201d he added. But when he walked into a mattress store to inquire, he discovered that wouldn\u2019t happen. \u201cThere was a long pause, and they said, \u2018No, we don\u2019t make dumpster home mattresses.\u2019\u201d\nWilson, who will get his water in a bucket from Lady Bird Lake, wants to involve the campus in the project. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to get the track team to help me bring up the water from Lady Bird Lake as a track exercise,\u201d he said.\nWilson doesn\u2019t look like a ladies\u2019 man. He\u2019s got nerd written all over him. He wears a bowtie, an old Open Road Stetson like the one LBJ wore, black high-top Converse basketball shoes and thick-framed glasses. Still, he must be a charmer.\nWhen Wilson isn\u2019t dumpstering, he\u2019s visiting foreign countries \u2014 with no luggage. He met his girlfriend, Austin writer Clara Bensen, last year online through the OkCupid website. Then he convinced her to tour Europe with him \u2014 with no bags. Wilson and Bensen visited eight countries in 21 days with little but the clothes on their back.\nIf you can convince a woman to tour Europe without a bringing a bag the size of a circus tent, your persuasive abilities are spectacular.\n\u201cHer friends said, \u2018We don\u2019t think you\u2019re crazy for going to Europe with no clothes. We just think you\u2019re crazy for going anywhere with Wilson,\u2019\u201d Wilson said.\nOK, so Bensen brought along one carry-on. \u201cShe took a purse, because she wanted to take two pairs of underwear,\u201d said Wilson, who brought only the underwear he was wearing.\nWilson explained the laundry regimen he recommends when you\u2019re traveling through Hungary, Turkey and Croatia with only a single pair of boxers.\n\u201cOn the first day, you wear your underwear under your jeans. On the second day, you go commando. And the third day, you wash clothes,\u201d he said. Is there a frat rat in America who isn\u2019t familiar with this routine? Except for the wash part.\nBy the way, Wilson doesn\u2019t figure his girlfriend will spend the year with him in his dumpster home.\n\u201cThere are visitation hours on campus, so my girlfriend can\u2019t stay overnight,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll appeal that.\u201d\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nAd\nLearn More\nYour premier men\u2019s tele-health clinic\nUnlock better performance with a quick 3-min survey\nOfNoah\n|\nAd\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

CNET Road Trip 2014 stopped by to see how the Dumpster Project could lead to healthier cities.\nDaniel Terdiman\nJuly 1, 2014 4:00 a.m. PT\n1 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nProf. Dumpster leaping\nAUSTIN, Texas -- In a world of dwindling resources, the average American lifestyle is almost certainly unsustainable. Yet most people don't have a model for how to live differently.\nThat's what Jeffrey Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, wants to provide. An environmental sciences professor and dean at Huston Tillotson University here, Professor Dumpster is in the middle of a project meant to prove it's possible to live super minimally, and super efficiently.\nFor a year, Professor Dumpster is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster -- outfitted, of course, for civilized living. But the goal is to do that living with zero waste, and extremely minimal use of power and water.\nAs part of Road Trip 2014, CNET reporter Daniel Terdiman came to the Texas capital to see just how comfortable one can be living in a glorified trash can. Turns out, if you're willing to let go of a few creature comforts, it's not too bad.\nPlease click here to read my full story on the Dumpster Project.\n2 of 20\nDumpster Project\nDumpster Project Phase III drawing\nCurrently, the Dumpster Project is in Phase I, and Professor Dumpster and his team are actively trying to raise money to proceed to the next stages of the initiative.\nThis document shows what the project is intended to look like when it's much further along. With multiple stories, and a developed garden, this dumpster could be sophisticated living for the minimalist-inclined.\n3 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nProf. Dumpster laughing\nStanding inside the dumpster, located at Huston Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, Jeffrey Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, laughs and enjoys his 33-square-foot home.\n4 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nPushing the water barrel\nIn its current state, the dumpster isn't connected to the grid in any way, which means that Professor Dumpster must get water the old-fashioned way -- by carrying it home. When he needs water, he pushes this water barrel, which holds 24 gallons, to Austin's Lady Bird Lake, an hour round-trip, where he fills it up. When he returns, he filters the water in order to make it potable.\n5 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nOn the phone\nThough the dumpster isn't connected to the grid, that doesn't mean Professor Dumpster is cut off from the world. He uses his iPhone to talk to people, and he spends much of the daylight hours at his university office, which is only a couple hundred yards away.\n6 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nHidden compartments\nAt first glance, you can't tell where Professor Dumpster keeps any of his clothes, bedding, or other important supplies. Then he opens a lid, revealing several hidden compartments under the floor.\n7 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nGarden\nOne element of the Dumpster Project is to grow a sustainable garden alongside the dumpster. Tended by Professor Dumpster and his students, the garden is turning out several kinds of vegetables.\n8 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nBaseline\nAs a way of demonstrating how much less energy and water he can live on than is used by the average American household, Professor Dumpster plans on installing a set of the average collection of household appliances next to the dumpster that he will use for a few months to establish an energy/water/waste consumption baseline. Then he will be able to compare his own usage to that of the baseline.\n9 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nIt's bigger on the inside\nAs an homage to Dr. Who and the Tardis, Professor Dumpster has a welcome mat outside the dumpster that reads \"It's bigger on the inside.\"\n10 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nCouchsurfing note\nProfessor Dumpster has not been the only one to live in the dumpster. Because it is a demonstration project, many others -- including his students -- have spent nights there. But he also opened up the dumpster to users of Couchsurfing.com, prompting this note from the first person to ever use that Web-based service to find a bed in a dumpster.\n11 of 20\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nLaying out bed pad\nBecause the dumpster's interior space is so small, Professor Dumpster must keep his bedding hidden away until he needs it.

And On\nHe's leaving the Dumpster to a new, rotating cast of residents\nBY NORA ANKRUM, FRI., FEB. 6, 2015\nprint\nwrite a letter\n\nProfessor Dumpster in his element (Photo by John Anderson)\nHas it really been a year already? Apparently so, says Huston-Tillotson University College Dean Jeff Wilson, who on Tuesday night concluded his year-in-residence in Austin's most esteemed trash can. During the depths of last winter's cold spell, the biology professor moved into a Dumpster on the west side of HT's campus with little more than a sleeping bag and an iPhone for comfort. As an experiment in \"less is more\" living, the Dumpster Project was intended to test the limits of both sustainable design and sanity. In regard to the latter, says Wilson, \"I'm way happier than before I moved into the Dumpster.\"\nIt turns out that a 6-by-6-foot metal box makes an adequate cave for reading, napping, or getting away from it all. At the same time, says Wilson, \"you're just kind of forced to engage more, and I think that's a big part of why I'm happier.\" He notes that the low rent and \"minute-and-a-half\" commute to the office don't hurt either.\n\"We didn't make it to that sort of uber-Dumpster that we wanted,\" says Wilson. \"One of the lessons learned is that it's pretty damn hard to renovate your house when you're living in it.\" A composting toilet, pop-up balcony, and other experimental design elements went unrealized. Still, the project team planted gardens, installed data monitoring equipment, and got an air-conditioning unit (more important than a bathroom, discovered Wilson). Other additions are forthcoming as part of student-driven Brainstorm for the Box design challenges.\nWilson gave the Dumpster a fresh coat of paint last week in anticipation of its next guest, Blackshear Elementary School Principal Betty Jenkins, who planned to stay overnight Wednesday to kick off the Dump\u00adster Project \"Home\" School residency program. Other resident teachers will follow (students\u00ad can nominate a teacher at www.dumpsterproject.org/homeschool). All will return to the classroom with a Dumpster 101 curriculum developed in partnership with EcoRise and Blackshear, and piloted by the roughly 1,000 K-12 students who visited the Dumpster over the last year.\nWilson, meanwhile, is postponing a return to normalcy. Instead, he'll be spending 99 nights in different homes around town (e.g., mansion, high-rise condo, nursing home, under a bridge), all documented and photographed by his partner, writer Clara Benson, and photographer Sarah Natsumi Moore. \"There's such a real housing crisis in Austin,\" says Wilson. \"This doesn't go directly to the heart of that, but it sort of dances around it a bit.\" He hopes to explore the meaning of home and to \"gather a little bit of data\" along the way. \"It would've been a pretty big culture shock to move back into a real house,\" he says. \"I've got to kind of transition.\"\nVisit www.99nightsatx.com to follow Wilson's couch-surfing journey or to nominate a home where he should stay.\nGot something to say on the subject?

It\u2019s fun. It gets the wheels of imagination turning.\u201d\n3 Phases\nThe project will involve three phases of Dumpster living: a camping site; an average American (Dumpster) home; and a space-capsule design or \u00fcber Dumpster. At each stage, students from elementary school to college will pitch in to plan and test solutions for the abode. Experts will also offer advice.\nIn the first phase, \"Professor Dumpster\" (Wilson\u2019s nickname) will have a 15-degree-rated sleeping bag for camping in the trash can tent. (Temperatures in Austin have been in the 40s this week.) He will filter water for drinking from a nearby lake and use campus facilities for bathing.\nDuring the second phase, the Dumpster will be flashier, \u201cplugged into the electrical and water grid\u201d and feature appliances, such as a washing machine and dryer, according to project details.\nDumpster Project / Facebook\nUltimately, Wilson wants to answer this question: \u201cCan you have a pretty good life living in 1 percent of the average new American home with 1 percent the energy, 1 percent the water, and 1 percent the waste?\u201d\nIn the third phase, the student team will attempt to get one percent of the energy and water use of an average American home, all contained in the tiny container.\nAt the end of the project, Wilson hopes to answer this question: \u201cCan you have a pretty good life living in 1 percent of the average new American home with 1 percent the energy, 1 percent the water, and 1 percent the waste?\u201d\nThe Ford Foundation is donating $75,000 to the effort.\nExpert Advisor\nOthers have also tossed around the idea of Dumpster living.\nIn 2011, California artist Gregory Kloehn transformed a trash container into a fully functional home, equipped with a working kitchen, toilet, storage and sleeping area.\nKim Aronson / YouTube\nIn this video, Kloehn offers a tour of his Dumpster design.\nKloehn is listed as a \u201cDumpster Yoda\u201d who will provide expert advice to the Dumpster Project team.\nLinkedIn\nFacebook\nX\nTagged categories: Aesthetics; Color + Design; Design; Eco-efficiency; Energy efficiency; Green building; Research; Sustainability\nComments\nJoin the Conversation:\nSign in to add your comments.\nMain News Page\nRESOURCES\nBuying Guides and Directories\nDownloads\nIndustry Standards\nInstructional Videos\nSOCIAL CONNECTIONS\nX\nFacebook\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nUSEFUL INFORMATION\nAbout Us\nMedia Kits and Advertising Submission Guidelines\nPaintSquare Staff\nPrivacy Policy\nRegistration and Free Subscriptions\nSite Map\nSocial Media\nSupport\nTerms and Conditions\nTHE TECHNOLOGY PUBLISHING NETWORK\nHeadquarters\n1501 Reedsdale Street, Suite 2008, Pittsburgh, PA 15233\nTEL: 1-412-431-8300\nEMAIL: info@paintsquare.com\nPaintSquare / JPCL\nCONTACT: sales@paintsquare.com\nPaint BidTracker\nCONTACT: sales@paintbidtracker.com\nWater BidTracker\nCONTACT: sales@waterbidtracker.com\nTPC Custom Publishing\nCONTACT: sales@technologypub.com",

The average home is more than 2,400 square feet.\nWilson added solar panels, electrical hook-ups and air conditioning to the space.\nEven though he is moving out, Wilson said the dumpster will remain on campus.\n\"We are launching what we call a dumpster home school. So under that effort teachers and educators can spend a night in here. Walk home, back to the classroom with curriculum on sustainability about living on less,\" he said.\nWilson said he hopes more affordable housing options that also conserve energy can be made available worldwide, and his next plan is to work on adding a second story on the dumpster.\nClose Ad\nWhat's the most effective method to generate a monthly secondary income?\nCommitTips\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nSuperfood Reviews\n|\nSponsored\nShop Now\nYour premier men\u2019s tele-health clinic\nOfNoah\n|\nSponsored\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nIf you have a mouse, this game will keep you awake all night long.\nPanzerQuest\n|\nSponsored\nGet $10 ActiveSG Anniversary Credits.

Space\nTuesday Feb, 04 2014\n(AUSTIN, Texas) 2.4.14 \u2014 Proving the premise that people can live with less, Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s Dean of the University College and Associate Professor of Biological Sciences, Dr. Jeff Wilson, will move into a 33-square foot dumpster for one year. On Tuesday, Feb. 4 at 1 p.m., (CST) movers will deliver Wilson\u2019s new abode to the HT campus at 900 Chicon Street, completely furnished with zilch.\nWilson, a recognized expert in the fields of Environmental Science and Environmental Health, is also Executive Director of The Dumpster Project, a registered Texas nonprofit focused on transforming sustainability education. He leads the project with a multi-disciplinary team of designers, academics, and students.  In his role as \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d at HT, he promotes Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education focused on reducing carbon footprints in an engaging, entertaining format. He has intrigued students with his methods in his popular Freshman Seminar class.  In addition, the newly formed Green is the New Black (GitNB) student organization under his guidance recently captured first place in the nationwide Ford Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Community Challenge held in Detroit, MI.\nThe students compiled a presentation around the theme titled, \u201cBuilding Sustainable Communities\u201d that captured an educational program to address issues of sustainability in Black and Hispanic communities.  The group introduced the challenge of transforming a 33-square foot dumpster into a fully functioning home complete with running water, toilet, shower, bed, and solar-generated electricity. Some students also plan to live in the dumpster.\n\u201cThe overarching goal of The Dumpster Project is to test whether one can have a pretty good life while treading lightly on the planet\u2014all from a dumpster that is one percent the size of the average new American home,\u201d Wilson said.\nThe dumpster transformation will teach students about the positive aspects of reducing the waste of space, water, and food. Wilson plans to use a dumpster as an experimental teaching tool in broad areas of sustainability, such as converting dirty water to clean, drinking water, and generating electricity to power electronic and home devices.\nIn addition to the dumpster move in, a dumpster \u201chouse warming\u201d party is planned on Friday, Feb. 7 at 4:30 p.m. on the campus in the Dickey-Lawless Science Building, Room 301.  Dumpster registry items include water filtering devices, a hammock, web cams, and a door mat.  He has generated support from Johnson Controls, Inc.; Texas Disposal Systems; Tree House Green Building Supply; and Whole Earth Provision Company.\nHT students Maurice Fleming and Olivia Sanchez, co-captains of the GitNB team, shared that the win helped raise awareness among minority communities traditionally left out of the sustainability conversation. Fleming is African American and Sanchez is Hispanic.\nWilson completed his post-doctoral work at Harvard and holds a doctorate in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury.  Over the course of his 13 years in higher education, he has been active in both research and teaching. He has authored dozens of articles in the area of environmental science and health and has received National Science Foundation funding for work on enhancing graduate studies and retention among underrepresented groups.\nDuring the past five years, HT has enhanced its STEM offerings by developing new Environmental Studies courses, renovating the Dickey-Lawless Science Building, retrofitting and upgrading the laboratories, incorporating energy efficient lighting with sensors, and installing new heating and air conditioning units throughout the campus to support carbon footprint reduction and sustainability efforts.\nRecently, HT was named a finalist in the 2014 Second Nature Climate Leadership Awards (CLA).  The annual competition is held among United States colleges and universities that are signatories of the American College & University Presidents\u2019 Climate Commitment (ACUPCC). The awards program is sponsored by Second Nature, a national nonprofit that seeks to create a sustainable society by transforming higher education, and Planet Forward, an organization that engages innovators and publishes compelling ideas for some of society\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\u201cWe continue to raise awareness of sustainability efforts within the campus environment in our efforts to influence behavioral changes that will ultimately benefit the greater society,\u201d said Larry L. Earvin, Ph.D, President and Chief Executive Officer\nReducing total municipal waste by more than 80% and other green efforts resulted in recognition for HT from the National Wildlife Federation. In 2008, the University received an award for its sustainability efforts and commitment to creating a campus community that focuses on recycling, energy conservation, and waste reduction.\nHuston-Tillotson University with roots dating to 1875, is the oldest institution of higher education in Austin, Texas, offering Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degree in 20 areas of study. \nFollow the coverage:\nKVUE (ABC)\nhttp://www.kvue.com/news/local/Professor-begins-yearlong-project-to-live-in-a-dumpster-243591771.html\nKXAN (NBC)\nhttp://kxan.com/2014/02/04/professor-will-live-in-dumpster-for-a-year/\nFOX\nhttp://www.myfoxaustin.com/story/24633789/professor-to-live-in-dumpster-for-a-year\nAustin American-Statesman\nhttp://www.statesman.com/gallery/news/local/huston-tillotson-professor-moves-dumpster-020414/gCHRG/#4505843\nYahoo News\nhttp://news.yahoo.com/blogs/oddnews/professor-sold-his-possessions-and-will-live-in-a-dumpster-for-the-next-year-to-teach-sustainable-living-193521861.html\n Culture Map\nhttp://austin.culturemap.com/news/innovation/10-16-13-austin-local-professor-to-spend-one-year-living-in-dumpster/\nHBCUConnect\nhttp://hbcuconnect.com/content/261727/huston-tillotson-university-s-professor-dumpster-to-move-into-33-square-foot-living-space\nBE SOCIAL WITH HT:\nSign Up for HT News\nABOUT HT\nEMPLOYMENT\nPUBLIC RELATIONS\n\u00a9 COPYRIGHT\nPRIVACY POLICY\nCONTACT",

For Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, this combination led him to something that could breathe new life into the ever-growing trends of multifamily housing, tiny homes and the Internet of Things.\nHe calls the new creation an \u201ciPhone you can live in,\u201d because of its small size and tech-rich devices such as Nest thermostats, solar panels and self-tinting smart glass.\nWilson, a professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University, decided to embark on a social and educational experiment where he lived in a used, 33-square-foot trash dumpster for a year.\nAfter six months, the temperatures inside started to rise to upwards of 132 degrees, so Wilson equipped the dumpster with air conditioning and electricity.

A third of rural Indians live in homes where each person gets just 65 square feet or less of living space.\nBut at 33 square feet, Austin University College Dean Jeff Wilson, a.k.a Professor Dumpster, has got them beat with his Dumpster Project. \nWilson took post-divorce downsizing to a whole new level by moving into a dumpster on the campus of the university where he teaches, paring down his possessions to some bedding, a couple shirts, and a few pairs of shoes and pants, all of which are stored in a compartment beneath a false floor installed into the dumpster, according to James Hamblin's Atlantic piece.  \nThe only thing Wilson did not skimp on was bowties (he has eight or nine), which arguably are necessary to add some flair to his otherwise limited wardrobe.\n                        Wilson moved from a  just-under-the-national-average 2,500-square foot home to the dumpster, which he is utilizing as an experiment to illustrate issues of sustanability and human needs to his students.\nAccording to the piece, Wilson has become more connected to his community (since his dumpster is too small and hot to actually spend time in, he tends to hang out in the laundromat.)\n\"I have met a much wider circle of people just from going to laundromats and wandering around outside of the dumpster when I would\u2019ve been in there if I had a large flat screen and a La-Z Boy,\u201d he says.\nHis zero-waste, zero-energy home lacks certain amenities most Americans would consider basic, such as a toilet. But Wilson, who admits his project is \"an outlier experiment,\"  is not alone there; even in the wealthiest country on earth, 1.6 million Americans lack indoor plumbing.\nWilson does have plans for a toilet, as well as a shower and a washer/dryer (so long, laundromat), all fueled by city water, a connection to the electrical grid, and a shade structure to protect the dumpster from the scorching Texas sun.\n    Image source: The Atlantic\nLonger term plans include a pop-up bedroom structure, folding balcony, and raised bed garden.\nWilson's goal is to demonstrate what is possible with ingenuity and a willingness to rethink how much stuff a person needs to own and store in a house for a happy life.\n\"What\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home,\u201d he tells the Atlantic.\nIf you have \"disposable income\" and would like to \"pitch in\" to help Wilson's project, visit his website and make a donation.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nNina Ignaczak\nNina edits and publishes the Planet Detroit newsletter (planetdetroit.substack.com) and writes and edits stories about all aspects of people and place.\nSUBSCRIBE\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest sharing news:\n*Required field.

He apparently had a lot of time to think in his dingy dumpster digs, and has since designed a line of tiny but technologically power-packed homes being manufactured in Austin.\nWilson calls the design Kasita - inspired by \"casita\", which is Spanish for \"small house\". He told KVUE-TV that his iPhone, which I'm sure was his only company in that dumpster, inspired him to create a home that would utilize every inch of space and pack features into a compact and sleek design.\nTech features include windows that dim or clear on command, a TV that slides in and out of view depending on when its needed, and customized ambient settings, all controlled by an app. They'll be on display at this year's South by Southwest festival in Austin, so look for them if you have a chance to head down there.\nEach 352 square foot house costs about $139,000, and there are plans in the works to build racks upon which to stack the homes like portable apartments.\n'Professor Dumpster' debuting affordable Kasita housing in Austin this fall\nSubscribe to KTEM-AM on\nCONTAINER HOMES COMING TO TEMPLE\nHANK THE COWDOG AUTHOR LOSES HOME IN NORTH TEXAS WILDFIRES\nFiled Under: News, Professor Dumpster, SXSW, SXSW 2017, Texas News, Tiny House\nCategories: Articles, News, Texas News\nMORE FROM KTEM-AM\nAustin Cancels SXSW Over Coronavirus Outbreak Concerns\nAustin Cancels SXSW Over Coronavirus Outbreak Concerns\nJordan Peele\u2019s New Movie \u201cUs\u201d To Premiere In Austin At SXSW\nJordan Peele\u2019s New Movie \u201cUs\u201d To Premiere In Austin At SXSW\nAustin Man Arrested for Bomb Threat at SXSW\nAustin Man Arrested for Bomb Threat at SXSW\nSXSW Shooting Suspect Leads Killeen Police on Car Chase\nSXSW Shooting Suspect Leads Killeen Police on Car Chase\nKilleen Man Arrested in Connection to SXSW Shooting\nKilleen Man Arrested in Connection to SXSW Shooting\nAustin Mayor Urges Residents to Work From Home Friday\nAustin Mayor Urges Residents to Work From Home Friday\nKilleen Man Identified as Driver in Deadly South by Southwest Crash\nKilleen Man Identified as Driver in Deadly South by Southwest Crash\nTwo Killed, Dozens Injured by Suspected Drunken Driver at SXSW\nTwo Killed, Dozens Injured by Suspected Drunken Driver at SXSW\nWHAT'S HOT\nO.J.

Jeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nJeff Wilson spent the last year living in a dumpster.\nAdvertisement\nIt's not what it sounds like: Wilson \u2014 who goes by the alter-ego \"Professor Dumpster\" \u2014 is an environmental science professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas who worked with his students and a team of experts to transform that dumpster into a sustainable home that cost under $10,000.\nWe first came across the project in The Atlantic, and now The Washington Post reports that Wilson's residency in the dumpster has come to an end.\nThe project's director of operations Karen Magid says that the dumpster's development is far from over, and that they're currently accepting applications from educators to spend a night in the dumpster as a catalyst for teaching their students about the environment and sustainability.\nWilson is now transitioning back to a noisy life full of the usual bills in a normal-sized house with his girlfriend, but plans to begin a new project soon: 99 Nights ATX, where he will spend 99 nights sleeping on couches in 99 different households in Austin.\nAdvertisement\nHere, Team Dumpster shared photos of the 6x6-foot trash receptacle that served as Wilson's home for the last year.\nAdvertisement\nThe Dumpster Project was originally intended to be completed in three phases, starting when Wilson took occupancy in February 2014: camping in a bare-bones dumpster (shown here); living in a dumpster \"home,\" with additions such as storage and a bed; and then fine-tuning the dumpster into the ultimate sustainable home, which will continue now that Wilson has vacated.\nSarah Natsumi Moore / The Dumpster Project\nEarlier in stage two, the project's current stage, a fake floor was installed to store Wilson's belongings and limited wardrobe. This dumpster will probably be preserved mid-stage two, and the team will turn their attention to another prototype.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nAdvertisement\nThe dumpster has been hooked up to electricity, although the team is looking at bringing in solar power. As far as water, \"the bathroom will always be a sticking point,\" Magid says.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nThe dumpster started to look a little more like home only a few months into Wilson's occupancy.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nAdvertisement\nHere, you can see its garden beds, mailbox, and sole window. The team hopes to eventually add more levels, as well as a bathroom, deck, and vegetable garden.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nWilson told The Atlantic that in the summer, his Texan dumpster can easily top 100 degrees, making it unbearable during the day. The team purchased an air conditioning unit to fight the heat \u2014 and he could always take refuge in his office. During his occupancy he relied on the university's shower facilities.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nAdvertisement\nThis photo was taken from the dumpster's sole window, which also functions as the door.\nSarah Natsumi Moore / The Dumpster Project\nThis shot from the \"skylight,\" \"retractable roof,\" or \"lid,\" depending on what you want to call it, gives a pretty good idea of the dumpster's dimensions, which decreased from 36 square feet to 31 square feet when the floor was added.\nSarah Natsumi Moore / The Dumpster Project\nAdvertisement\nNow that Wilson has moved out, the team will continue adding to the home \u2014 or another dumpster prototype \u2014 with a focus on making sure it uses 1% of the energy and water used in of the average American home.\nJeff Wilson / The Dumpster Project\nYou don't have to move into a dumpster to find affordable housing ...\nHarned's Bar-B-Q in Reidland, McCracken County.

Wilson, a recognized expert in the fields of Environmental Science and Environmental Health, is also Executive Director of The Dumpster Project, a registered Texas nonprofit focused on transforming sustainability education. He leads the project with a multi-disciplinary team of designers, academics, and students.  In his role as \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d at HT, he promotes Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education focused on reducing carbon footprints in an engaging, entertaining format. In addition, the newly formed Green is the New Black (GitNB) student organization under his guidance recently captured first place in the nationwide Ford Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Community Challenge held in Detroit, MI. \n\u201cI would like to show that it can be done. We will see if that pans out. If you really can live in one percent the size, use one percent the water, use one percent the electricity and create one percent the waste,\" said Dr. Wilson. The dumpster from Texas Disposal Systems is six feet by six feet, for a total of 36 square feet. It feels even smaller once you're closed in at night. Dr. Wilson, or Professor Dumpster, is committed to downsizing the American dream.  \"You can have a pretty dang good living in one percent the size of the average American home,\" said Dr. Wilson.\nThe dumpster from Texas Disposal Systems is six by six feet, for a total of 36 square feet. It feels even smaller once you're closed in at night. He\u2019ll start with just a hammock, but hopes to add solar power, a composting toilet and maybe even a shower. All possible through grants and sponsors including AEN partner, Texas Disposal Systems.

Their work began, rightfully, by cleaning the dumpster out, as seen in this Instagram clip: \nThe idea is for the dumpster to gradually progress from few amenities to the latest in sustainable technology \u2013 all while maintaining a \"net zero\" model of energy use.\nWilson credits those student volunteers \u2013 Green is the New Black \u2013 as the group guiding and pushing the project. \"I'm just the guy living in the dumpster and acting as their advisor.\"\nWilson \u2013 a white professor at a historically black college \u2013 says the volunteers' \"vision is to transform the way that the green conversation is going in our particular community, over here at Huston-Tillotson \u2013 and they are fostering new shades of green as the roots of our future.\"\nThey should have a little help \u2013 the Dumpster Project recently won a  $75,000 grant from Ford Motor Company. \n\"The key endpoint,\" says Wilson, \"at least for me, would be that there is a conversation \u2013 contextual to whatever an individual\u2019s beliefs and thoughts are \u2013 around issues of less and more.\"\nCare to see it for yourself?

Dr. Jeff Wilson of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas literally (or litter-ally as he likes to spell it) lives in a dumpster. \nIt's all part of The Dumpster Project, an experiment in sustainability that sees Professor Dumpster and students at Huston-Tillotson retrofitting a dumpster to meet sustainable and livable standards. \"Science needs to be juiced up a bit,\" said Wilson. \"I have been an environmental science teacher for the past six years, and I'm tired of kids falling asleep in class.\"\nThe Dumpster Project has certainly gotten people's attention. Dr. Wilson and his students recently hosted a \"dumpster warming\" party to mark the start of what will hopefully be a long a fruitful endeavor for all involved. Around 250 people came to the event, which was accompanied by student presentations related to the project.\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of the Dumpster Project is its symbolic nature, as Wilson will be conserving resources where they are normally discarded. Nevertheless, Wilson believes that facilitating dialogue is more important than metaphorical meaning. \"The end game is that the dumpster becomes a conversation,\" said Wilson. \"For some people it'll be about sustainability, for some people it will be about less is more, for some people it will be a business proposition. We just want a conversation.\"\nAs of now, the dumpster is still in what Wilson describes as the \"primitive camping\" phase. This means that Wilson is essentially camping, except that his tent is a dumpster. But Wilson plans on transforming his humble abode into an \"\u00fcber dumpster\" equipped with solar powered electricity while at the same time using only 1% of the energy and water used in a normal American home.\n\"This is an experiment to show that one can have a pretty good life using limited resources.\" While initially trepidatious, the administration at Huston-Tillotson is now fully supportive of the project. But not everyone is as enthusiastic, as some bizarre and misdirected criticism has come his way. \"I've been accused of telling people that under Obama we have to live in dumpsters,\" said Wilson.\nThough the project has undeniably provoked discussion, the educational opportunities that it provides is perhaps its most tangible effect. For the students at Huston-Tillotson, an historically black college, this aspect of the Dumpster Project is invaluable.\n\"What's so cool (about the project) is the students,\" said Wilson \"Over 90% are first generation university students, and for them to have exposure to global experts is an amazing opportunity.\"\nWilson particularly highlights the contributions of Green is the New Black, a student group at Huston-Tillotson that is committed to transforming the environmental conversation within African-American and Latino communities.\nYou can follow the Dumpster Project's progress on Professor Dumpster's Twitter and Instagram pages.\n--Image courtest of Jeff Wilson\nCallum Beals is an editorial intern at Sierra. he recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz where he studied history and literature.

The first house will be delivered at the end of June, but prospective buyers can tour the model home at 1304 E. Fourth St.\n\nThe application for orders opened Friday, and while the company will not reveal how many orders it has received since Friday, Kasita Director of Communications Courtney Lowell said they are \"overwhelmingly pleased\" with the demand.\n\n[g-slider gid=\"228018\" width=\"100%\" height=\"55%\"]\n\n\"Everything is designed with the idea of user experience,\" Lowell said of the microhouse. That means smart home technology, greater use of storage space and easy delivery\u2014Kasitas are manufactured in a factory in a few weeks and delivered in one piece via flatbed truck.\n\nBy December, Kasita hopes to start selling stackable houses. Imagine nine tiny homes, one on top of the other, accessible by an exterior, covered elevator, on a lot that would otherwise be unusable, Lowell said.\n\nThe houses on sale now even come with a discount\u2014buy three or more, and the price drops to $119,000 each.\n\nLowell said, eventually, the company hopes to see the units sold for an even more affordable price.\n\nShe said Austin was the perfect place to create and debut the Kasita, outside of technology-heavy areas ,such as Silicon Valley and New York City. Austin, she argues, is the \"quintessential\" place to launch Kasitas because of its current housing situation.\n\nCommunity leaders have said the key to making Austin affordable is to make affordable housing available. According to data from the Austin Board of Realtors, the median single-family home price in Austin rose 10.6 percent to $345,000 since September 2015. The National Association of Homebuilders reports for every $1,000 increase in the median home value, 1,285 Austin families can no longer afford the market.\n\nLowell said the idea is to place Kasitas in underutilized spaces\u2014rooftops, parking lots, areas that are too small to build conventional houses or apartments. And similar to an iPhone, Kasitas are able to be mass-produced because there is not much customization, so it is less expensive to manufacture.\n\nWilson\u2014who started out in a 33-square-foot-dumpster on Austin's Huston-Tillotson University campus three years ago\u2014said he hopes his product eventually goes global.\n\nBy Marie Albiges\nThanks for reading!\nDaily news about your community is free, and your support is invaluable.\nGive $10 now towards CI's journalistic mission across Texas.\nBecome a CI Patron\nAustin Metro\nAustin Metro Home\nBastrop | Cedar Creek\nCedar Park | Far Northwest Austin\nGeorgetown\nLake Travis | Westlake\nLeander | Liberty Hill\nNorth Central Austin\nNorth | Northwest Austin\nPflugerville | Hutto\nRound Rock\nSan Marcos | Buda | Kyle\nSouth Central Austin\nSouthwest Austin | Dripping Springs\nHouston Metro\nHouston Metro Home\nBay Area\nBellaire | Meyerland | West University\nConroe | Montgomery\nCy-Fair\nCypress\nHeights | River Oaks | Montrose\nKaty North\nKaty South | Fulshear\nLake Houston | Humble | Kingwood\nPearland | Friendswood\nSpring | Klein\nSugar Land | Missouri City\nThe Woodlands\nTomball | Magnolia\nDallas | Fort Worth Metro\nDallas | Fort Worth Metro Home\nFlower Mound | Highland Village | Argyle\nFrisco\nGrapevine | Colleyville | Southlake\nKeller | Roanoke | Northeast Fort Worth\nLewisville | Coppell\nMcKinney\nPlano North\nPlano South\nProsper | Celina\nRichardson\nSan Antonio Metro\nSan Antonio Metro Home\nNew Braunfels\nNorth San Antonio\nNortheast San Antonio Metrocom\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nYoutube\n(866) 989-6808\nTERMS OF SERVICE | PRIVACY POLICY |\n\u00a9 2005-2024 Community Impact Newspaper Co.

        "content": "Meet Professor Dumpster, the American College Professor Who Lives in a Dumpster\nBy Sumitra on September 16th, 2014 Category: News\nShare\nTwitter\nReddit\nDr. Jeff Wilson, a professor of environmental science at a university in Austin, Texas, is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year. He kickstarted the unique project in February, and his efforts have earned him the nickname \u2018Professor Dumpster\u2019 among his students. Harvard-educated Wilson says that his goal is to show people that it is possible to have a pretty good life even in austere conditions.\nThe dark green dumpster is currently parked behind the women\u2019s residence halls in a corner of Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s campus. Wilson describes it as \u2018the most thoughtfully designed, tiniest home ever constructed\u2019. Before he moved in, Wilson\u2019s students cleaned and fixed the dumpster for him, making sure that it wasn\u2019t smelly or unfit for living. And to make the dwelling as energy efficient as possible, they plan to set up solar panels and an energy producing toilet.\nHaving previously lived in a sprawling 2,500 square foot house, Wilson started downsizing his life after going through a divorce. He moved into a 500 square foot apartment, and sold all his spare clothes and furniture for $1 per item. He soon realized how little he needed to survive, and dumpster-living sounded like a great idea.\nWhen the lease on his apartment ran out, he moved into his office for seven months, while setting up the dumpster. \u201cKeeping that secret for seven months, especially from the 3am cleaning staff and the 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself,\u201d he admitted.\u201d But he soon pitched the idea at work, and got the university to sanction and support The Dumpster Project. The project revolves around using only one percent of what the average American uses \u2013 one percent of the space, the water, and the energy, and producing only one percent of the waste.\n\u201cWe could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d Wilson said, while pointing out the merits of a dumpster home. \u201cFueled by sunlight and surface water, people could have a pretty good laugh.\u201d He\u2019s a big believer in minimalism now \u2013 he owns only four pairs of pants, four shirts, three pairs of shoes, three hats, and a few bow ties. All his worldly possessions are stored under a recently installed false floor, along with camping cooking equipment.\nIt took Wilson a few months to get used to the place, but after installing some useful amenities, he started feeling comfortable in his new home. One of the first things he did was to replace the tarp roof with a sliding pitched roof with a weather station on top. Six months after he moved in, he installed a modest air conditioner in an effort to cope with the terrible Austin heat.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make it too easy,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI wanted to see how elastic my sleeping habits would be relative to temperature and humidity. I found that I could actually get to sleep pretty well as long as I went to bed at about 11:00pm.\u201d Using the weather station, he tracks his personal climate in real time, he pulls up weather-related data to know what to expect.\nWilson said that a lot of good things have happened because of the project \u2013 the summer\u2019s been unbearable, so he spent more time in the community, walking around and interacting with people. \u201cI almost feel like East Austin is my home and my backyard,\u201d he said proudly.\nIn the second phase of The Dumpster Project, Wilson will receive more amenities like a bed, a lamp, and a dome to catch rainwater and provide shade. He will also have a tiny sink and a kitchen, and locks, making it the only dumpster in the world with interior locks. But the one thing he\u2019s eagerly waiting for is a toilet.\nHe currently uses facilities at the university\u2019s gym, but \u201cgetting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run,\u201d he said. He will soon have his own shower and toilet, though, which will be connected externally. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed-up 36 square feet,\u201d he explained.\nThe third phase of the project will see Wilson entering the \u2018uber dumpster home\u2019 \u2013 his dumpster will be unplugged from the energy grid and solar panels will be installed instead. More aesthetic work will be done as well, minimizing the dumpster effect. \u201cWe kind of want to do the outside in a modern Dwell look,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want it basically to be such that if you were blindfolded and placed inside it, you\u2019d just think you were in a very tiny house.\u201d\n\u201cWe bring everything into the home these days,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to leave home for anything, even grocery shopping, anymore. What\u2019s interesting about this (project) is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home. The big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less? So far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I\u2019ve had before.\u201d\nHaving said that, Wilson does have an arrangement in place in case he needs an occasional break from the box. His students can opt to take his place for the night.\nOnce his year of dumpster living is up, Wilson plans to take his bin across the United States, to educate students about the concept of \u2018less is more\u2019. He\u2019s already going around to local elementary and middle schools to talk about his experience of living in a home with no modern facilities. One of the most pressing questions he\u2019s been asked is: \u201cHow is Santa going to get in?\u201d\nPhotos: The Dumpster Project/Facebook\nSources: ABC News, MSN\nShare\nTwitter\nReddit\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

Tuesday night, the 6ft 1in Professor Dumpster posted a picture of his new abode on Twitter with a maroon sleeping bag laid out tightly in the small space with little else in view.\nIf occasionally Wilson needs a break from the box, students can opt to take his place for the night.\nOne student, Evette Jackson, has already signed up.\n+\n9\nView gallery\nMod cons: Thankfully for Wilson, pictured, his new home isn't your ordinary smelly dumpster but a special version customized by his students that includes creature comforts like a shower, kitchen, bed, WiFi and toilet\n+\n9\nView gallery\nNot very big: Wilson posted a picture of his new home on Twitter Tuesday with the comment 'Bird's eye view of dumpster home at bedtime'\n'I think it's pretty intriguing,' she told KVUE. 'It's pretty cool. I want to live in it too.'\nAfter the year of dumpster living is up, Wilson plans on taking the bin across the United States, educating students about the possibility of following in his 'less is more' footsteps.\nWilson said the project idea came to him two years ago while he was sipping a latte at Starbucks.\n'I looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight-yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that I was definitely moving into a dumpster,' he told Fast Company.\nSo when the lease ran out on his lovely, full-sized, apartment a year later, he posted an announcement on Facebook, which read: 'Starting at 6pm, I will be selling all of my home furnishings, clothes, kitchen appliances, and everything else in the apartment for $1 an item.'\n+\n9\nView gallery\nHelp: Wilson, right, had help from students and other educators including Dr Karen Magid, pictured\n+\n9\nView gallery\nConcerns: A week before move in, Wilson wrote a list of his concerns with 'heating' number one\nDespite, the five-item-per-person maximum, his home was empty by nightfall except for a modest suitcase, which was coming with him to the dumpster.\nHowever, the dumpster wasn't ready at this stage, so he moved into his office for the next seven months, secretly sleeping on the floor.\n'Keeping that secret for seven months, especially from the 3 a.m. cleaning staff and 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself,' he told the website.\nBut the low-impact living experiment, officially known as The Dumpster Project, is finally ready to begin - and it has the university's backing.\n+\n9\nView gallery\nScrub: Five days ago, Wilson was giving his dumpster a clean out\n+\n9\nView gallery\nCute: Wilson posted a picture of him and his girlfriend two weeks ago with the comment, 'Honey, I'm home. This place looks like a dump'\n+\n9\nView gallery\nVs: Wilson's previous front porch was slightly more desirable\n'I'm essentially becoming part of the 1 per cent, he jokes. 'This dumpster is 33 sq ft, which is 1 per cent the size of the new American home...'\nBut as he undergoes this transformation, so will his students in campus dorms, whom he'll expect to replace light-bulbs and install low-flow shower heads.\nThe goal is to bring sustainability to the center of the college experience.\n'What we are talking about right now is to start a green movement within historically black colleges and universities, and become the flagship school of that, under an initiative called \"Green is the New Black,\"' he told Fast Company.\nIn the meantime, Wilson says he's going to take his dumpster life one day at a time. 'It's going to be pretty overwhelming,' he said. 'I can't think too far ahead in this project and stay sane.'\nTexas university professor moves into a DUMPSTER\n: 0%\n: 0%\n0:00\nPrevious\nPlay\nSkip\nMute\nCurrent Time\n0:00\n/\nDuration Time\n1:19\nFullscreen\nNeed Text\nShare or comment on this article: Jeff Wilson moves into a DUMPSTER on university campus for a year to show students that they can live with less\nRecommended by\nThe Average IQ in Singapore is 108.

The average home is more than 2,400 square feet.\nWilson added solar panels, electrical hook-ups and air conditioning to the space.\nEven though he is moving out, Wilson said the dumpster will remain on campus.\n\"We are launching what we call a dumpster home school. So under that effort teachers and educators can spend a night in here. Walk home, back to the classroom with curriculum on sustainability about living on less,\" he said.\nWilson said he hopes more affordable housing options that also conserve energy can be made available worldwide, and his next plan is to work on adding a second story on the dumpster.\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nAd\nLearn More\nYour premier men\u2019s tele-health clinic\nUnlock better performance with a quick 3-min survey\nOfNoah\n|\nAd\nIf you have a mouse, you will never turn off your computer again.\nPlay this game for 1 minute and see why everyone is addicted.\nDesertOrder\n|\nAd\nGet $10 ActiveSG Anniversary Credits.

Clearly there\u2019s a certain type of mind that looks at a giant trash bin and thinks \u201chome sweet home.\u201d But Wilson, an honest-to-god environmental science professor at Huston Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is the first one we know of to make college students part of his dumpster-based life.\nGrist Weekly | The best of Grist\u2019s essential climate reporting, delivered straight to your inbox every Saturday.\nSign up now\nFastCoExist reports that Wilson started his dumpsterventure by selling off everything he owned, \u201cexcept for a suitcase filled with dumpster-ready essentials, a Sun God totem from Kazakhstan, and a pair of lederhosen.\u201d Then he moved on into the former trash receptacle, where he\u2019ll spend a year tracking his waste, water, and energy usage.\nHe\u2019ll start by sleeping on the floor in the bare-bones cleaned-out bin, but by the end of the project, Wilson and his students will have kitted out the dumpster to be the ultimate efficient living space:\nGrist thanks its sponsors. Become one.\nNext, Wilson and his students will make it comfortable, but wasteful, installing modern conveniences like air conditioning, lights and a toilet. Its inefficiency will be carefully tracked in order to develop a baseline. \u201cI\u2019m actually going to, for a few days, carry all my water in five gallon buckets up from town lake, filter it, and use it in the dumpster,\u201d says Wilson.\nOnce it\u2019s fully operational, they\u2019ll take this deluxe dumpster and give it the full no-impact-man treatment. \u201cI might say, \u2018Looks like that drier is really hogging a lot of energy; What would happen if I just sold that on Craigslist and made myself a clothesline?\u2019\u201d Wilson says. He imagines proceeding from low-hanging fruit like energy-efficient bulbs to nano-insulation and energy-producing toilets, \u201cuntil eventually, we get a completely pimped out dumpster.\u201d\nThe plan is for Wilson\u2019s students to enact similar efficiency improvements in their dorms \u2014 and his \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d character will even spread the message to younger kids. But perhaps not Wilson\u2019s own 6-year-old: \u201c\u201cMy ex-wife did not express a lot of encouragement in our daughter sleeping with daddy in a dumpster.\u201d Jeez, hasn\u2019t this lady seen Sesame Street?\nA message from   \nAll donations matched for a limited time!\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Picture: Sarah Natsumi\nThe 6ft 1in professor spent a year living on campus in the cramped space. Picture: Sarah Natsumi\nHe had no water or electricity, so he went back to basics. Picture: Molly Mandell\nThanks goodness for smartphones.

I spent more time in the community and on campus. I cut my commute from 30 minutes to 30 seconds, and my rent was almost nothing. I found myself thinking outside the box from within the box.\u201d\nProf Wilson came up with the Dumpster Project with the help of students and experts, renovating the garbage container to create a tiny, sustainable home. And it certainly brought him closer to nature.\n\u201cIn the middle of the Texas summer it got to 45C or 46C, and down to -3C or -4C in winter. I didn\u2019t have heating or air conditioning for six months, so that was pretty rough.\u201d\nNo matter how freezing the weather, Prof Wilson would have to slip into his thermals and dash across campus to use the toilets and gym showers.\nSPONSORED\nUS Citizen Abroad?

He's moved out from the dumpster, yes, the dumpster, he called home for one full year on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas.\n\nHe's an Environmental Studies professor who he says he wanted to prove you can be happy and healthy in a very small space the way millions of people live around the world. Very small is an understatement try 33 square feet compared with the almost 2,500 square feet of the average American home.\n\nIn reality, it was sometimes less than ideal. He did have some amenities though, like a mailbox, air conditioner, and eventually solar power.\n\nWilson says he wants to be the ultimate one-percenter: Create only one percent of the waste of the average home, and use one percent of the energy and water.\n\n\n\nMore on AOL:\nWhy you should always be kind to strangers on public transit\nThe most wonderfully awkward moments on the Oscars red carpet\n89-year-old grandpa surprises Tinder dates, and their reactions are amazing\nView comments\nTerms/Privacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardAbout Our Ads",

The only difference is that he goes home to a recycling bin, not an ordinary house.\nIn early February a university professor in Austin, Texas, moved into a 33-square-foot dumpster, where he plans to live in for a year. Wilson\u2019s experiment is aimed at showing his students at Huston-Tillotson University, as well as the whole world, that people can happily live in a smaller space while lessening their impact on the environment.\n\u201cIn America, the average American homes are about 2,500 feet more or less, and we wanted just to see whether one can have pretty good life on a lot less. So in this case we are living in 1 percent of size of average American home and our main hypothesis is that one may have a pretty good life in much, much less,\u201d Wilson told RT.\nDr. Jeff Wilson, who is now known by the nickname \u201cProfessor Dumpster,\u201d is a Harvard-educated environmental science professor and dean of the University College. He managed to transform an ordinary, smelly dumpster into a comfortable accommodation with a shower, kitchen, bed, toilet and even Wi-Fi. This project turned out to be very successful and warmly welcomed by students, though Dr. Wilson didn\u2019t ask anyone to abandon their homes and join him.\n\n\u201cThis is actually a science experiment, it\u2019s an educational experiment. We wouldn\u2019t expect anybody else to be crazy enough actually to live in 33 square feet. What we hope is to show that one can have a very good life at that level,\u201d Wilson said.\n\u201cI think we are teaching a good lesson on living on less and some sustainability lessons here,\u201d he added.\nLiving in a dumpster on the campus doesn\u2019t only serve as example of a sustainable accommodation but allows Wilson to cut his expenditures on rent and saves him commuting time. The only \u201ccosts\u201d are that he sometimes gets nocturnal visits from his students when they have some questions about their homework.\n\u201cThe only rent I\u2019m actually paying right now is the extra 15-20 hours that I\u2019m working a week for free at the university just by communicating when the students come by night. That is probably my rent,\u201d Wilson told RT.\nWilson argues that he has really become much happier and is has a better life. He plans to continue the experiment for another six months at least, probably another year.\n\u201cWe are going to see where we will end up. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be moving back to a \u2018conventional American home\u2019 any time soon, but probably won\u2019t downsize either. When you are at the bottom, when you are at that space, you at least can feel that you have a big space, even if it is a 200-square-foot New York studio apartment,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe point here is that I\u2019m living a pretty normal life, eat meat from time to time, I drive a normal car, I have a girlfriend. The only difference in my life is that instead of going home to a house, I\u2019m going home to a dumpster,\u201d Wilson said.\nThe statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.\nThe statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.\nOPINION\nYou can share this story on social media:\nFollow RT on\nTop stories\nMacron comments on Durov\u2019s arrest\nWoman traveling with Pavel Durov named (IMAGES)\nFrench prosecutors reveal potential charges against Durov\n15 Interpol countries join hunt for WWII Nazi SS veteran \u2013 Moscow\nToncoin cryptocurrency falls 19% after Durov arrest\nFoo Fighters slam Trump\nRussia strikes Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure \u2013 MOD\nHow the EU tightened the noose on Telegram EXPLAINER\nSubscribe to RT newsletter to get news highlights of the day right in your mailbox\nWe offer you the possibility to receive RT's news highlights every Monday, Wednesday and Friday by email.\nSubscribe\nRT Features\nSwing states that matter: The real reasons behind Trump and Harris VP picks FEATURE\n\u2018Imagine if it were Moscow?\u2019 How prominent Russians reacted to arrest of Telegram founder Durov FEATURE\nRussian officer, Finnish hero, Hitler\u2019s ally: The fascinating story of Carl Mannerheim FEATURE\nPodcasts\nAll podcasts\nModi has leveraged the inherent power of India on a global scale \u2013 senior BJP member Ravi Shankar Prasad\n0:00\n22:52\n\u201cGood guys\u201d of the West: LGBT propaganda, persecution of churches, promoting wars\n0:00\n24:41\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\nESP\n\u0420\u0423\u0421\nDE\nFR\nRS\nRT News App\nNews\nRussia & Former Soviet Union\nBusiness\nAfrica\nIndia\nRT Features\nAnalysis\nOpinion\nEntertainment\nShows\nProjects\nLive\nApplications\nWhere to watch\nSchedule\nSponsored content\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy policy\nAbout RT\nRT Promo: Hall of Fame\nContact info\nFeedback & Complaints\nVacancies\n\u00a9 Autonomous Nonprofit Organization \u201cTV-Novosti\u201d, 2005\u20132024.

That\u2019s how long Jeff Wilson, also known as \u201cProfessor Dumpster,\u201d lived in a green Dumpster on the Houston-Tillotson University campus. Wilson converted the bin into his home to promote sustainable living. He wanted to show his environmental science students that humans can live on a much smaller scale and lessen their environmental footprint.\nLast February, the professor sold all his possessions and decided to live in the 36-square-foot Dumpster, which he says is 1 percent the size of the average American home. The concept came to him while sitting in a Starbucks.\n\u201cI was revising a journal article thinking about, \u2018How could I make my research more applicable to student learning?,\u2019 and then I looked out the window and saw the Dumpster and thought: \u2018That\u2019s it,'\u201d Wilson told KXAN last year.\nThroughout the past year, the Dumpster has completely transformed. It started with just a sleeping bag, like a camping site. Now, the \u201chome\u201d is connected to the electrical grid and climate-controlled with small heating and air conditioning units. It also includes a false-floor basement \u2014 that stores cooking equipment, bedding and clothing \u2014 an improved roof, and an online weather data station for the Dumpster.\nThe professor is celebrating his one-year anniversary in the Dumpster on Wednesday with students, staff and people in the community from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit nostalgic, like the home you grew up in and moving out of,\u201d said Wilson.\nThe Dumpster will now become part of a new project called the \u201cHome-School Program,\u201d where different educators can come stay in the Dumpster as a way to motivate and inspire their classes. The professor is already working on his next educational gimmick. Shortly after Valentine\u2019s Day, Wilson is launching \u201c99 Nights ATX.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to couch surf around Austin to investigate what makes a house a home,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cSo everywhere from the largest homes on the west side to some of the tiniest homes on the east side.\u201d\n\u201cI think the big lesson that my students learned, some of them even spent a night in the can, is that you can have a pretty good life on a lot less. And by moving to smaller, you can move closer to the things \u2014 and even people \u2014 in the community that you love,\u201d Wilson said.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

For one year, the Huston-Tillotson University professor lived in a 33-square-foot renovated dumpster to teach students about science and sustainability.\n\"Essentially, I was just sitting there one evening thinking about all the good things about the dumpster,\" said Wilson. \"It was highly affordable, I could transport it and I got to spend a lot more time in my hood, the neighborhood I wanted to be in and I thought, 'Okay, let's take this and work on it.'\"\nWilson created a team to start the company Kasita.\n\"This is an amazing team,\" said Wilson. \"We have Robert Keith at W2 MacFab in East Austin who runs a genius shop that's one of the only places that could actually make this, and Taylor Wilson [no relation] a young developer doing micro units here in East Austin.\"\nKasita is a play on the Spanish word \"casita,\" which means \"little house,\" and that's exactly what Wilson's company is building. Small, pre-fabricated homes that are just 208 square feet.\n\"Iconically designed. It looks as beautiful as these million dollar condos down here and will rent in Austin for about $600 a month,\" said Wilson. \"This is not a dumpster. This has a walk-in shower, a queen-size bed, a desk, a table and then this beautiful glass cube in the front that brings a lot of light into the space.\"\nThe couch in the living room pulls out into a queen-size bed. There are storage units and closets built into the walls and a step next to the couch is actually storage for up to 50 pairs of shoes. The walls in the units are made of tiles that can be customized to hold speakers or shelves.\nThe units themselves fit into rack structures. Each rack can hold nine units; three across and three units high. The racks can be placed next to each other or you can fit one rack into a space as small as 1,000 square feet, such as a parking lot. And if you want to move, crews just pull your unit out of the rack and install it in another rack structure.\nWilson said as cool as the idea is, it's actually a solution to urban living.\n\"Yeah we're making a cool house. Yeah we're making a small thing that moves around, but the people of this city and the people in America can no longer afford to live in the cities that they love and that's the heart of the problem we're going after,\" Wilson said.\nKasita already has two lots in Downtown Austin that will be ready in 2016. By 2017, Kasita plans to expand to 10 cities across the country.\nClose Ad\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nUS Citizens in Singapore can still vote in 2024.

He will live in the dumpster for a year to show that people can live with less. Wilson, HT's Dean of the University College and Associate Professor of Biological Sciences, is also the leader of The Dumpster Project, a nonprofit focused on sustainability education. Wilson will sleep on campus in the dumpster which will eventually be transformed into a fully functioning home with running water, toilet, shower and solar-generated electricity.

One man is challenging that notion.\nJeff Wilson, a college professor from Austin, TX lived in a dumpster for an entire year. In his 6-by-6 foot dumpster, Wilson was able to install solar power, basic cooking accommodations,  a composting toilet, and a solar heated shower.\nWilson\u2019s goal was to prove to his students that he could live on 1% of the electricity and water the average American uses in 1% of the space.\nNow that the project is over, Wilson is rolling out dumpster-inspired micro homes via his new company, Kasita. This startup company builds tiny homes packed with the most advanced technologies to reduce the carbon footprints of their occupants.\nFrom flat screen TVs, to clothes washers, these tiny homes have all the amenities we\u2019re used to in a fraction of the space. While the median American home size is 2,467 square feet, Kasitas are 352.\nWhile this model is a bit different from the 6X6 original that is near and dear to our hearts here at RDD, it\u2019s difficult to forget the roots of the first Kasita microhouse. \n  Posted in Industry News\nHear What Our Satisfied Customers Have to Say\n\u2039\nCompetive pricing, careful and skilled delivery and placement and removal, and on time.\nReview of , reflecting an experience on 5/8/2024 by Scott G\nGreat service.

It didn't own me.  I spent more time outdoors and exploring the neighborhood, I had more disposable income,\" Wilson said.\nWilson says while laying in the dumpster and looking up at the stars one night, he had an idea.\n\"Hey...maybe there's something here.  Maybe we could make something out of this experiment that could solve part of the affordability crisis that we face here in Austin,\" he said.\nTwo years later, Wilson is the CEO of Kasita -- a fully-realized idea that's actually happening later this year.\n   \nKasita is a start-up.  So they were looking for venture capital -- but....\n\"I'll just say that's going pretty well,\" Wilson said.\nBasically what we're talking about -- a structure called a \"Kasita Rack\" will be built.  The rack will hold the \"Kasita Units\" that will be stacked into it. \n   \nWilson says the model in East Austin is 50% smaller than what the actual units will look like.\n\"It is a 320 square foot mass manufactured, pre-fab, high quality, but affordable housing product,\" he said.\nAnd the units are mobile.  So in theory, Kasita owners can move them from city to city.\n\"We will have a series of these racking structures that a crane will lift them in and can plug them actually into the structure,\" Wilson said.\nProfessor Dumpster says the beta version or \"model 1\" of the Kasita system is under construction now in the Austin area.  It's expected to make its debut this fall.\n   \nFrom there, Wilson hopes to build Kasitas around the world. \n\"In the case let's say the city wanted to provide affordable housing to teachers and firefighters and police officers.  Those folks could own a home and park it on city property so that we were insuring that those real foundations of what makes up Austin were able to afford a place to live,\" Wilson said.\nDr. Wilson says the Kasita units will go on sale this fall. \n   \nHe's coy about how much they will cost but insists they'll be more affordable than what people typically pay for rent here in the Austin area. \n   \nAnd no property taxes...so in theory once it's paid off you just pay your utility bill.\nDAILY NEWSLETTER\nAll the news you need to know, every day\nBy clicking Sign Up, I confirm\nthat I have read and agree\nto the Privacy Policy\nand Terms of Service.\nJust In...\nView More\nAnita Byington case: Convicted killer's claim of innocence goes to Court of Criminal Appeals\nMURDER-SUICIDE at Rice University: Female student found dead in dorm room, unidentified male found with self-inflicted gunshot wound\nTexas removes over 1M ineligible voters from voter rolls\nAlzheimer\u2019s and other dementia diagnoses can vary by zip code, new study finds\nFamily still looking for answers after man was robbed, killed in Bastrop\nTrending\nMissing: Daughter of former MLB pitcher not seen since August 22\nEast Austin shooting: 2 teens arrested for murder after 13-year-old was killed\nFamily still looking for answers after man was robbed, killed in Bastrop\nTexas removes over 1M ineligible voters from voter rolls\nVoters to decide on property tax increase to help Austin ISD budget deficit\nLatest Videos\nvideo\nInside the Campaigns' Sleeper Strategy\nvideo\nTexas purges voter rolls of over 1M voters\nvideo\nWalter Ratcliff Jr. case: No arrests made\nvideo\nAPD investigating deadly SE Austin shooting\nvideo\nTeen killed in attempted robbery in East Austin\nNews\nLocal\nTraffic\nTexas\nPolitics\nCrime and Public Safety\nFOX News Sunday\n2024 Election\nGood Day\nBirthday Shoutouts\nKeeping Score\nCooking with FOX 7\nLive Music on FOX 7\nAdoptable Animals\nContests\nQuestions for Your Garden\nFOX Local\nHow to Stream\nTierra's Texas\nFOX 7 Espa\u00f1ol\nThe Texas News Show\nGood Day Austin Extra\nThe Sports Office\nGood Day Music Take 2\nThe Backstage Experience\nBattleground\nFOX Weather Austin\nFOX 7 Exclusives\n7 On Your Side\nCrimeWatch\nMissing in Texas\nHealthBeat\nTexas: The Issue Is\nFOX 7 Focus\nCare Force\nFOX 7 Discussions\nATX-tra\nAbout Us\nWhat's On FOX\nContact Us\nNewsletter Sign Up\nFOX 7 News Team\nWork for FOX 7 Austin\nInternships\nClosed Captioning\nFCC Public File\nFCC Applications\nAntenna Help\nWeather\nDownload the FOX 7 WAPP\nFOX 7 Web Cams\nFOX Weather\nDid You Know?\nSports\nAustin FC\nNASCAR\nMLB\nTexas Longhorns\nFOX 7 Friday Football\nTexas Basketball\nRegional News\nDallas - FOX 4 News\nHouston - FOX 26 Houston\nfacebook\ntwitter\ninstagram\nyoutube\nemail\nNew Privacy PolicyUpdated Terms of UseYour Privacy ChoicesFCC Public FileEEO Public FileAbout UsJobs at FOX 7Contact UsFAQ\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92024 FOX Television Stations",

Then an instructor with the Ann Richards School will dive in.\nThe \"Home School\" program is not just for teachers \u2013 students can sign up, too. For more information, click click here.",

He admits managing the toilet smells can be an issue\n+\n9\nView gallery\nMaintaining a comfortable temperature was initially a problem until Mr Wilson built temperature controls\nDesigns may include solar power generation, a composting toilet, a flat screen television, and a passive-solar heated shower \n'I'm not as concerned about the shower,' he told The Atlantic, 'but getting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run.'\nCurrently, he uses facilities at the university's gym, but a toilet and shower will soon connect to the dumpster externally. \n'You don't really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed-up 36 square feet,' he explained. \nAfter the year of dumpster living is up, Wilson plans on taking the bin across the United States, educating students about the possibility of following in his 'less is more' footsteps.\nWilson said the project idea came to him two years ago while he was sipping a latte at Starbucks.\n'I looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight-yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that I was definitely moving into a dumpster,' he told Fast Company.\nSo when the lease ran out on his lovely, full-sized, apartment a year later, he posted an announcement on Facebook, which read: 'Starting at 6pm, I will be selling all of my home furnishings, clothes, kitchen appliances, and everything else in the apartment for $1 an item.' \nDespite, the five-item-per-person maximum, his home was empty by nightfall except for a modest suitcase, which was coming with him to the dumpster.\nHowever, the dumpster wasn't ready at that stage, so he moved into his office for the next seven months, secretly sleeping on the floor until he moved in, in Feburary. \n'Keeping that secret for seven months, especially from the 3 a.m. cleaning staff and 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself,' he told the website.  \nHe said: 'We hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing, energy sustainability, science education, and higher quality of life.\n'Ultimately, the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing.\n'This is an outlier experiment. The students and university, thought they thought the experiment a bit odd, have warmed to the idea, even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to.'\n   Share or comment on this article: Texas professor Jeff Wilson adjusts to life in a dumpster\n14\nshares\nRecommended by\nThe Average IQ in Singapore is 108.

And it could help change the future of housing.\nMaz Ali\n10.24.15\nHe was living in a dumpster when the idea first came to him.\nHis name's Jeff Wilson \u2014 Dr. Jeff Wilson, actually. He's a professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, known fondly on campus as \"Professor Dumpster.\"\n0 seconds of 0 seconds\n00:02\n03:03\nPhoto by Jeff Wilson/Wikimedia Commons.\nWilson made himself the guinea pig in a year-long experiment on sustainable living.\nHe traded a 3,000-square-foot home and most of his worldly possessions for a spartan 33-square-foot living space created in a big green dumpster.\nWilson's experiment eventually became a nonprofit called The Dumpster Project that \"invites learners of all ages to rethink sustainability through the quirky task of turning a dumpster into a home.\" Photos (exterior, interior) by Unilarity/Wikimedia Commons.\nIn an interview with the Washington Post, Wilson said the experience made him happier than he's ever been. He was unburdened by the weights of adulthood, saving big on rent and utilities, doing less housework, cutting his commute down to near-nonexistence, and just having less stuff to clutter his space and mind.\nLiving in a dumpster may not be for everyone, but Wilson thinks smart home engineering can yield the same benefits.\nCase in point: tiny houses. They're exactly what they sound like \u2014 homes of varying tininess, often pictured in bucolic ruralities.\nPhoto by Benjamin Chun/Flickr.\nSome are craftily adapted from materials not typically used with home building.\nPhoto by ROLU/Flickr.\nAnd some are designed to go with you when you want to move.\nPhoto by Guillaume Dutilh/Wikimedia Commons.\nTiny houses are gaining more attention as a viable housing alternative, which is great news for a few reasons.\nThey're an option \u2014 for the crafty and willing \u2014 withaffordable housing growing scarcer as cities sell out their locals for higher bidders. Then there are some, like Wilson, who just want to live simpler, less materially crowded and wasteful lives.\nWilson's verve for simple living became an entrepreneurial mission \u2014 to build a new generation of smart homes.\nHis company is called Kasita, but they're not building homes for country living. They're bringing the tiny house movement to the city \u2014 although, in a press statement, they say they don't call what they're building \"tiny houses\":\n\"The Kasita completely reimagines the home with industrial design at its core. There's nothing quite like it out there. The Kasita does not contain a loft, Murphy bed, pitched roof, or wheels. It's designed from the ground up as opposed to an adaptation of an existing structure intended to store and transport merchandise (but we have lots of love and respect for our friends in the Tiny House and container communities!).\"\nTheir 208-square-foot design slides into multi-level structures called \"racks,\" which connect to municipal utilities like electricity and plumbing.\nThe first rack is scheduled to open in Austin in 2016, and plans are underway to build them in 10 more cities by 2017.\nWith Kasita, you can move your entire home to any city with a rack. All you have to do is make a call, schedule a big-rig pickup, and off it'll go to your next destination.\nKasitas are equipped with all the amenities of a modern home, including a kitchen with a cooktop, convection oven, and dishwasher; a bathroom with a walk-in shower; and a combined washer and dryer unit.\nThe walls use a special tile system that lets you customize the space to your needs.\nPlus, they'll have voice-activated components like lighting, entertainment, and a hidden queen-size bed that rolls out on your command, like a boss at bedtime.\nTo make Kasita an affordable housing opportunity, they're building community partnerships for creative land use.\nThey haven't yet announced pricing for buyers, but one of their stated goals is to offer rentals at half the market rate of standard studio apartments. In the country's most rapidly gentrifying cities, that could add up to serious savings.\nHousing may be an internationally recognized human right, but not enough is being done to ensure everyone has access to it. Until then, it's encouraging to know there are businesses out there like Kasita that aren't just in the business of making things worse.\nKasita won't stop the housing crisis dead in its tracks. But if it proves successful, it could help inspire the kind of innovation we need to eventually send it flying off its rails.\nInformation from your device can be used to personalize your ad experience.\n\nDo not sell or share my personal information.\nA RAPTIVE PARTNER SITE\nFAMILY\nMoms rally around woman who planned entire family vacation but was met with only complaints\n\"Gratitude goes a long way\u2014especially on family vacation!\"\nHeather Wake\nUpworthy Staff\n08.24.24\n@a.millennialmama/TikTok\nLuckily, this story has a happy ending.\n\nEven for those who love the thrill of making vacation itineraries\u2026it\u2019s work. And obviously when the planning has to be done for an entire family, there\u2019s even more effort needed to be put in. Imagine going through all the rigamarole of booking flights, hotels, rental cars, restaurant reservations, entertainment venues, last minute store runs for toiletries\u2026without getting so much as a \u201cthank you.\u201d\nOdds are you\u2019d be a little miffed, even if planning is your thing.\nThis was the scenario that a mom Alexis Scott found herself in after planning a summer vacation for her husband and two teen children. Thankfully, the now-viral TikTok post venting her frustrations inspired several folks to give her some much deserved support.\nIn the video, Scott began, \u201cI'm on a family vacation right now with my two teenagers and my husband. We flew in late last night. We think we got in at like 12:15 a.m. and headed to get a rental car and then got to our Airbnb. And I am frustrated.\u201d\nScott had tried and tried to get any input from her family about what they might want to do, and each time got the same reply: \u201c\u2018Whatever you want, mom. I don't care. Okay. I don't care.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Glad I'm planning this vacation for everybody to not care,\u201d Scott lamented.\nStill, she did the planning\u2014cause someone had to do it. But as soon as the vacation started, all her decisions were met with complaints. From being called \u201ccheap\u201d for getting too small of an SUV rental car to being told \u201cMom is never going to be in charge of booking the Airbnb again. She can't even this, that and the other,\u2019\u201d after the family found out their AirBnb was three stories with quite a few stairs.\n\u201cThen this morning, we wake up and it's an urban setting. We live in a very quiet suburban setting and my husband's saying how he barely slept and this and that. And I'm just like, enough!\u201d she said.\nAll of this happened within the first 24 hours of the trip. It\u2019s easy to see why Scott needed to vent.\nHer video concluded with:\nI have been the only one to put in all the effort in planning this trip. And I know there's videos on mental load, but this is prime time example of me. I'm shouldering the mental load for my entire family and everybody has something to say about it. So, yeah, I'm frustrated. Please pray for me that we can all turn our attitudes around and have a great day.\u201d\nDown in the comments, viewers could totally empathize with Scott for feeling burnt out and disappointed.\n\u201cOh gosh the mental load of planning every detail and then knowing is something goes wrong or isn't\u2019 perfect it\u2019s all on you. Been there,\u201d one person shared.\nAnother added, \u201cI tell my husband that I haven\u2019t been on vacation since I was a child and he\u2019s alway confused bc to him, \u2018we\u2019 go on vacation every year. Only other moms would understand what I mean.\u201d\nMany suggested that she do something for herself instead.\n\u201cJust Irish goodbye one morning, go to brunch alone, hit the spa or a pool and come home after dinner,\u201d one person wrote.\n\u201cGo and do whatever you want to do!! Spa day sounds perfect and take yourself out for fabulous meals!!\u201d echoed another.\nOn a positive note: this story does have a happy ending. In a follow-up video, Scott shared how she showed her family the TikTok video she made, and it did turn things around.\n\n\u201cWe have actually had a really, really great day today,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone has had positive attitudes. I've heard a lot of thank yous and my kids have been buying their little side purchases with their own money and not even asking me to pay for it... but they have been really self-sufficient in that space.\u201d\nAll in all, Scott recognizes that her family is \u201chuman,\u201d and a big part of being human is apologizing when a mistake is made and moving forward.\n\u201cWe love each other. This was a learning experience.\u201d\nBy the way, Scott's entire TikTok is dedicated to relatable mom content.

But it seems to be that the snacks are what causes people to feel most upset when that nostalgia kicks in. Maybe it's because as you age you no longer play with toys and aren't very interested in tween shows from the 80s or 90s, those sorts of things are expected to go away.\nFoods and snacks on the other hand really crank up the fond memories because they're things you can taste and smell. You remember them with all of your senses. So when someone asked what discontinued food do you still mourn, more than 30k people had something to add to the list. Here are some of the most requested:\n1. SoBe Drinks\nThe \"lizard drink\" 90s kids just couldn't get enough of. Technically, you can still find the drinks in very few places, they're just extremely difficult to locate and have been since early 2021 according to Mashed. One person wrote in the Reddit thread that Washington state has them in select areas, prompting one person to reply, \"please tell me where you've seen it, I live in Western WA and have not seen it in years. I am willing to drive literally hours for a sobe.\" Apparently grocery stores in Kenmore, Washington carry the 90s drink or you can buy them in bulk from the PepsiCo website supposedly.\n2. McDonald's Box Cookies\nIn a far, far away time in the late 1900s, McDonald's used to carry delicious little boxes of cookies with McDonald's characters on the boxes. They came in similar boxes to old school animal crackers but the formula for those cookies were nothing short of delicious. Then the restaurant giant stopped carrying them after the mid 90s before bringing them back in the 2000s but in a small bag. They're gone again, now everyone has the sads.\n\"Those McDonaldland cookies were the only thing that got me through my first pregnancy. Just the smell of them would make the morning sickness fade. I miss them,\" one person shares.\n\n3. Flintstones Push-Ups\nThose push-ups were delicious and clearly orange was the superior flavor. Even though the ice cream treat was designed to be contained in the tube, you always wound up sticky with orange juices running down your arm and face. The paper tube was notorious for starting to disintegrate before you were able to get to the bottom. One person admitted that the treat was the one thing she knew would make her feel better while sick, \"I was sick last week and my boyfriend asked what he could get me and I blurted out...\"push-pops.\" I had no idea where it came from, but my soul knew. It remembered.\"\n4. Orbitz drink\nThe drink that looked like a lava lamp with little flavored beads that bursted like boba. Orbitz wasn't around very long and maybe the fact that it did look like a decorative lamp had something to do with it but still people miss the non-carbonated drink. It came onto the market in 1996 and was gone by 1998. Someone suggested with the popularity of boba, Clearly Canadian may be able to pull off a comeback for the nostalgic drink, \"Yes! I thought of the \"lava lamp drinks\". I think these would do better now with the popularity of boba. They were just too far ahead of their time.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Wikimedia\n5. Carnation Instant Breakfast Bars\nApparently people have strong feelings about the discontinuation about these bars with more than one person cursing Nestle for the demise of the bar. Someone enthusiastically agrees the bars should've stayed around, \"I'm not the only one!!!!!!!!!! Those things were amazing. They tasted good and were actually filling. Whoever decided to stop making those was a moron. They really need to bring those back.\"\n6. Yogos\nThese delicious balls of childhood memories were apparently a choking hazard but it didn't stop people from eating them. Was it the risk of aspiration that caused the company to pull the plug on the yogurt covered treat? \"My kid almost choked to death on one of these back in like 03-04. They were real good tho...,\" one person shares. According to commenters Costco has a dupe called Yoggies that tastes similarly to Yogos.\n\nSome other popular mentions were Altoids Tangerine Sours, Blue Pepsi, Crystal Pepsi and Fruit Stripe Gum. People are demanding that some of these things return so they can continue their nostalgic journey with the real thing in hand. While there's no plans to petition companies, at least people know they're not alone in their longing for long lost snacks.\nFrom Your Site Articles\nThe 'Last Gen X playground' has been found, and people can't contain their nostalgia \u203a\nDad's TikTok for son showing what his 80s childhood was like is ... \u203a\nPeople are sharing the \u201990s trends they totally want back and it\u2019s an oasis of nostalgia \u203a\nNOSTALGIC PRODUCTS\nEDUCATION\nMom shares how her first grader's homework on the second day of school broke his spirit\n\"It's breaking their spirit and it robs them of what little fun and family time they have when they come home after a long day of school.\"\nAnnie Reneau\n08.22.24\nPhoto credit: Cassi Nelson/Facebook\nHow much homework is too much homework?\nDebates about homework are nothing new, but the ability of parents to find support for homework woes from thousands of other parents is a fairly recent phenomenon.\nA mom named Cassi Nelson shared a post about her first grader's homework and it quickly went viral. Nelson shared that her son had come home from his second day of school with four pages of homework, which she showed him tearfully working on at their kitchen counter.\n\"He already doesn\u2019t get home from school until 4pm,\" she wrote. \"Then he had to sit still for another hour plus to complete more work. I had to clear out the kitchen so he could focus. His little legs kept bouncing up and down, he was bursting with so much energy just wanting to go play. Then he broke my heart when he looked up at me with his big teary doe eyes and asked\u2026. 'Mommy when you were little did you get distracted a lot too?!' Yes sweet baby, mommy sure did too! I don\u2019t know how ppl expect little children to sit at school all day long and then ALSO come home to sit and do MORE work too\u2026.\"\nNelson tells Upworthy that she was \"shocked\" that kindergarteners and first graders have homework, much less the amount they were expected to do. \"We didn't have homework like this when we were in these younger grades.\"\nExpert opinion and research is somewhat mixed on the homework front, but there isn't any conclusive evidence that homework is universally beneficial for students and too much homework can actually be harmful. As a standard, the National Education Association (NEA) and the National Parent Teacher Association (NPTA) support a limit on homework of \u201c10 minutes of homework per grade level.\"\nWith that as a guide, a first grader shouldn't have more than 10 minutes of homework on any given school day, but it's not unusual for young kids to have two or three times the recommended limit of homework. That can be stressful for both kids and parents, cutting into valuable family time and limiting kids' time to decompress, play and freely engage in imaginative activity.\nAs Nelson concluded, \"It\u2019s breaking their spirit and it robs them of what little fun and family time they have when they come home after a long day of school.\"\nMost parents and even most teachers in the comments agreed with her that four pages of homework is too much for a first grader, especially on only the second day of school:\n\"Poor little man. Children below a certain grade should not be given homework! Small children have a hard time sitting still for a long period of time yet alone expected to sit and do hours of homework, for what??? They are SMALL CHILDREN! Let them snack, play, laugh and all the other fun things when they get home. You are only a child once, they don't need that taken away from them. Let them embrace their inner creativity, imagination, recipes, etc.\"\n\"This breaks my spirit. Our schools are huge scams. You're exactly right Cassi. Homework is ridiculous. Kids til the age of 10 primarily learn through real life situations and play scenarios.\"\n\"I hate that for him! My little one has ADHD and doing homework after sitting in class all day is very stressful to him and makes him hate school. They are in school for 7 hours they shouldn\u2019t have homework. That definitely takes away any kind of family time and that\u2019s why kids never spend time with parents anymore because they have all this homework to do after being gone all day.I feel that if it can\u2019t be done in the 7 hours they have the kids then it should wait until the next school day.\"\n\"I don\u2019t make them do homework at home when they are that little. It\u2019s not fair!They are at school allllll day! And it\u2019s already sooooo much for their little bodies and brains! I\u2019ve never had a teacher upset about it either.. and even if I did oh well!\"\n\"That breaks my heart. 4 pages is absolutely ridiculous for young kids. My daughter is going into 2nd grade next month, the 2 years in school it was always 1 page of homework sometimes back and front if it was math. And to read.\"\n\"I was in this boat with my son\u2026conversation with the principal and teachers helped dramatically!! It\u2019s too much and we have to advocate for them.\"\nNelson was blown away by the response to her post, which has been shared on Facebook over 89,000 times. \"I NEVER thought me sharing my thoughts openly about how my heart hurt watching my little guy struggle would connect to so many others worldwide going through the same thing,\" she says.\nMany parents shared that excessive homework is one of the reasons they decided to homeschool their children, which Nelson took to heart. The week after sharing her viral homework post, she shared that they had had their first day of homeschooling. It was \"A HUGE SUCCESS!!!!\" she wrote, with her son getting far more work done in a far shorter amount of time, sitting for classes for just 1 hour and 45 minutes total.\nNelson tells Upworthy she was totally intimidated to try homeschooling. \"I seriously thought there was no way,\" she says. \"But I knew I had to set my fear aside and just take the leap for my kids. I told myself I'd figure it out one way or another. And here we are three days in and it's been the easiest and best choice I've ever made.\"\nHomeschooling is not going to the right solution for every family, however, so the question of homework remains an important issue for kids, parents, teachers and schools to work out.\nFrom Your Site Articles\nSecond-grade teacher shares unique homework policy and it has parents sighing with relief \u203a\nAn Irish school is ditching homework for a month, assigning 'acts of kindness' instead \u203a\nAs a teacher, I used to give tons of homework.

It gets worse when some of these young whipper-snappers think they know more about the event than those alive when it happened.\nGen Xers, those born approximately between 1965 and 1980, lived through many pivotal moments in history, including the end of the Vietnam War, the Challenger disaster, the War on Terror, the AIDS epidemic, the contested 2000 election, 9/11, the election of Barack Obama, the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan, the death of Kurt Cobain and the OJ Simpson murder trial.\nSo, it\u2019s funny for people in their 40s and 50s to be lectured by a Gen Zer (those born between 1997 and 2012) about moments they saw firsthand. A few years back, an X user named SameOldStay brought the issue to the attention of many Gen Xers in a viral tweet.\n\nRecently, a group of Redditors on the Gen X forum took up the cause. People started sharing the times when young people tried to lecture them about historical moments that they never lived through but most likely heard about on TikTok.\n1. Don't tell me about 9/11\n\"I was an airline pilot on 9/11 flying from Atlanta to LaGuardia. Don't f**k with me, younglings.\"\n\"A younger Millennial once insisted to me that we dial 911 for emergencies in honor of the victims of 9/11.\"\n2. Gen Z OJ takes\n\"My oldest kid told me how OJ Simpson may not have killed his ex-wife, and the matching DNA was likely his son Jason. Listen here, I didn\u2019t watch court TV for 6 weeks and read 20 books on the case to have you lecture me about a 10-second TikTok clip that 'solved' the crime of the century!! You don\u2019t even know who Kato is!\"\n3. Rose-colored glasses\n\u201c'In 1986, you could work part-time at a yogurt shop in LaJolla, CA and afford a 3 bedroom home on the ocean.' No. Parts of this country have always been super expensive to live in.\"\n\"I admit to getting tired of hearing how easy it was for me to get through college and such 25ish years ago. I also remember the 70s and 80s, and amazingly, my parents could not afford a giant house with one person working as a coffee shop attendant.\"\n\"Every generation has some hardships, and today's young people have been screwed over in some ways, but they go way overboard with how easy it was for everyone before them.\"\n4. Why are they arguing?\n\"I teach middle school and have had this happen. Kids are arguing with me, and I\u2019m like, 'See this little crack in the floorboard? I was literally standing on it RIGHT HERE while watching this happen LIVE on TV.'\"\n\"Younger people, kids, and most people in general now, have super easy, fast access to information, right or wrong. They usually don't ask people who've actually lived through it, they just swipe and click and choose the information that is more shocking or in line with whatever ideas they already have about the event.\"\n\n\n5. Culture isn't that homogenous\n\"The most common one I see is from younger writers proclaiming that 'The entire country was up in arms about [insert major event]'... I was there, the reality is that most of the country didn't really care either way, but a few hundred protestors made a lot of noise.\"\n\"It\u2019s the same with the past. Like the roaring \u201820s. Everyone thinks the flappers and the whole F. Scott Fitzgerald vibe was everywhere when all of that was actually a smaller set of people.\"\n6. The Iraq war\n\"Someone was explaining how we had to invade Iraq to find the people who did 9/11. It was just too much for me to even try.\"\n\"Close, close friend of mine was killed in Iraq (with me there). At the funeral, his son accepted the flag the military presents to the next of kin. The photo became really famous. Had a Gen Zer tell the picture was staged by the military as military propaganda (without realizing how dumb the thought of the military spreading pictures of crying 7-year-olds in an attempt to improve their image, is). I tried showing them pictures, etc to show the family is real. She responded by saying I was one of 'those.'\"\n7. Nuclear bomb drills\n\"I've had people tell me I'm making up the nuclear bomb drills we did in elementary school in the 80s.\"\n8. History-challenged\n\"I was chaperoning my daughter\u2019s trip to Washington DC. The Millennial tour guide said he was going to take the kids to see the Challenger Space Shuttle.\"\n9. No, Communism isn't great\n\"Imagine being a person who grew up in former soviet union listening to young people talk about the benefits of communism.\"\n\n\n10. Haunted Mansion history\n\"I was chaperoning a trip to Disney, and one of the teens confidently told me The Haunted Mansion ride was based on the movie with Eddie Murphy. She was wondering why Eddie Murphy didn\u2019t appear in the ride. The other Gen Xer I was with explained the ride came first, like Pirates of the Caribbean.\"\n11. AIDS was very, very, very bad\n\"I had someone tell me that AIDS wasn\u2019t a big deal because well 'they had drugs for that.' I literally said to them I need you to shut up right now because you\u2019re looking like the most stupid person in the planet right now. Pulled out old Google and showed them how many people died, why, and how horrid it was. Like I had friends who died.\"\n12. The attitude is the problem\n\"This happened to me yesterday. It wasn't so much that this zygote was wrong, it was how obnoxiously arrogant and condescending he was about it.\"\n13. Y2K wasn't a big deal\n\"My favorite is the retconned Y2K they had to \u2018live through.'\"\n\"Yeah, I don't recall Y2K being taken seriously by the masses.\"\nFrom Your Site Articles\nSomeone asked Twitter, \u2018What's the most Gen X thing you ever did?\u2019 and the responses were awesome. \u203a\nGen X has hit 'that stage' of life and is not handling it very well \u203a\nGen X values that need to come back - Upworthy \u203a\nGEN X\nPOP CULTURE\nJennifer Garner's 'nerdy farm facts' about pumpkins is delightfully educational\nThe overalls \ud83d\ude0d\nHeather Wake\n08.26.24\n@jennifer.garner/Instagram\nJennifer Garner can talk about pumpkins with us all day, everyday.\nMove over PSLs. The new mark of fall is Jennifer Garner sharing \u201cnerdy farm facts\u201d from her very own pumpkin patch.\nIn an adorable video posted to her Instagram, the \u201c13 Going on 30\u201d actress sported dungarees and a sun hat while holding a large yellow flower (spoiler alert: it\u2019s a soon-to-be pumpkin) and educating us all on how pumpkins grow.\n\u201cThis flower is both male and female. There\u2019s a pistol inside and it needs the pollen,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you know who takes care of that? Bees! Thank you for the bees!\u201d\nContinuing her delightful and informative spiel, Garner tried to hold up the flower to show where the pollen from said bees might fall inside it. However, the wind kept the flower from exposing itself in such a way.\n\u201cOh\u2026she\u2019s shy\u2026\u201d Garner quipped.\nOnce pollen does reach inside the pistol, \u201cthe miracle continues.\u201d Garner then held the flower sideways to show what looked like the botanical version of a pregnant belly, and said, \u201cThis is when you get the email that says, \u2018Congratulations, Mama Pumpkin. Your baby is the size of a large grape.'\"\nAs Garner explained, this is when the seedling \u201ckeeps growing and growing,\u201d to the point where the flower portion will eventually \u201ccurl and dry off.\u201d\nPicking up a full formed pumpkin still growing on a vine, she added that, \u201cit\u2019s like a little umbilical cord, it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\nCut to Garner holding up two small green pumpkins, joking that they are \u201ca nice size b.\u201d\nWatch Jennifer Garner\u2019s \u2018Nerdy Farm Facts\u2019 video now:\nDown in the comments, viewers were bee-yond happy with Garner\u2019s pumpkin presentation.\n\u201c\ud83c\udf83 \ud83d\udc1d This cracks me up (and so informative!),\u201d one person wrote.\nAnother echoed, \u201cWell done! Thank you for educating us \ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf83\ud83d\ude4c. You\u2019re the best \ud83d\ude02!!\nStill another suggested that Garner start her own \u201cchildren's educational show \ud83d\udc4d\u201d\nA few also mentioned that those little blossoms are delicious in quesadillas. Recipe courtesy of Homesick Texan below:\nSquash Blossom Quesadilla Recipe\nIngredients\n1 poblano pepper\n24 squash blossoms, stems and stamens removed.\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1/2 half medium-yellow onion, diced\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon dried epazote (can substitute with 1/4 fresh cilantro)\n1/4 teaspoon kosher\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n1 1/2 pounds (6 cups) Oaxacan, Monterey Jack, or Muenster cheese, grated\n12 corn or flour tortillas\n6 tablespoons unsalted butter\nSalsa verde, for serving\nInstructions\nPut the poblano under the broiler for about 10 minutes, turning once until it blackens. Place in a plastic bag, close it and let it sit for about 20 minutes. After this time has passed, take poblano out of the bag, peel it (skin should shred off easily), remove stem and seeds and dice.\nGently wash the squash blossoms (there might be bugs inside) and remove stems and stamens. Roughly chop.\nHeat skillet to medium and add the olive oil. Add onions and diced poblano and cook for about 5 minutes or until onions are translucent.\nAdd garlic, epazote, squash blossoms, salt, and pepper and saut\u00e9 for 10 minutes or until all the liquid from the flowers has evaporated. Remove from heat and set squash-blossom filling aside. Taste and adjust seasonings, if needed.\nIn a skillet heated to medium, melt a tablespoon of butter. Add a tortilla and cook it on one side until it puffs (about 30 seconds). Flip tortilla over and sprinkle over entire surface 1/4 cup of squash blossom filling and 1/2 cup of grated cheese.\nTop with another tortilla, and after cheese has melted and the 2 tortillas stick together (a couple of minutes), flip quesadilla and cook for a couple of minutes more or until lightly browned.\nRepeat for the remainder of the filling and tortillas. Serve warm with salsa verde on the side, if you like.\nSounds like a great recipe for Garner to try on her \u201cPretend Cooking Show.\u201d It\u2019s sure to be utterly wholesome and entertaining, just like everything else she does.\nFrom Your Site Articles\nJennifer Garner shares the deeply thoughtful reason she would like to go to divinity school \u203a\nJennifer Garner overwhelmed by the friendship bracelets she received at a Taylor Swift concert \u203a\nJennifer Garner's 'embarrassing' reveal of items in her bag is delightfully unhinged \u203a\nJOY\nGet stories worth sharing delivered to your inbox\nEmail Address\nBy signing up you agree to Upworthy's privacy policy.\nTrending Stories\nMODERN FAMILIES\nMom explains the common Boomer parenting style that still affects many adults today\nTIKTOK\nAirbnb host has world riveted over stolen painting that was replaced inside her own home\nSCIENCE\nThe oldest whales on the planet are more ancient than 'Moby-Dick' and have the harpoons to prove it\nGEN Z AGING\nMillennial shares 'proof' they've set the new standard for what it looks like to age\nJENNIFER GARNER\nJennifer Garner works with paparazzo to create an act of kindness for homeless man\nHOUSING\nMan figured out how to beat squatters at their own game.

CNET Road Trip 2014 dives in.\nDaniel Terdiman\nJuly 1, 2014 4:00 a.m. PT\n7 min read\nJeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, demonstrates how he makes his bed in his 33-square-foot home -- inside a dumpster in Austin, Texas.\nDaniel Terdiman/CNET\nAUSTIN, Texas -- When you cross Bill Nye the Science Guy with Oscar the Grouch, you end up with a high-energy, charismatic character who is hoping to help change the world by living in a dumpster.\nMeet Professor Dumpster, the university dean who's currently in the middle of spending a year with a glorified trash container as his home.\nIn Austin, Prof. Dumpster lives the good life (pictures)\n+17 More\nSee all photos\nThis, of course, isn't your everyday dumpster, filled with garbage and smelling like week-old fish. Professor Dumpster, whose real name is Jeff Wilson, and who teaches environmental sciences at the historically African-American Huston Tillotson University here, has outfitted the dumpster he's lived in since February with some of the niceties of civilized living: a couple of lights, stow-away clothing, and even a bed with the \"Star Wars\" sheets he had as a kid.\nBut the list of niceties halts abruptly when it comes to things that require even the average amount of energy or water used, or the amount of waste generated, in a typical American household. This is an off-the-grid home meant to help people understand just how unsustainable the average American lifestyle is.\nI've come to Austin, the capital of Texas, as part of CNET Road Trip. Though I've been spending day after day at Naval bases, with the Air Force, and at a large airline headquarters, this visit to Wilson's 33-square-foot home seems to me to have every bit the national and international impact. As he puts it on the Dumpster Project's official Web site, \"What does home look like in a world of 10 billion people? How do we equip current and future generations with the tools they need for sustainable living practices? [The] dumpster will transform from a barely habitable used garbage container to a sustainable house and interactive teaching lab.\"\nMr. Minimalist\nThough this is the first time Wilson has lived in a dumpster, it's not his first shot at living minimally. A few years ago, when he got divorced, he began the slow process that eventually led him here. He moved into an 800-square-foot apartment, and when that lease ended, he sold almost everything he owned, and started living out of his University of Texas at Brownsville office.\nBut that was boring. He wanted to take his minimalism further. This is a man who met his current girlfriend on OkCupid and convinced her that their first date should be a three-week, eight-country adventure in which neither brought anything more than what they were wearing. Sound like a great story? New Line Cinema, the film production company, thought so. It has optioned the rights to the book his girlfriend, Clara Bensen, is writing based on the article about the date she penned for Salon.com.\nOne day in November 2012, sitting in a Starbucks, Wilson gazed out at the parking lot, and saw a dumpster. \"I called my most sane friend,\" Wilson remembered, \"and said, 'look, I want to move into a dumpster and do a project on it.' I was hoping she'd talk me out of it.\"\nHer reaction was this instead: \"It's on. Let's roll.\"\nEnergetic and charismatic\nBack in Austin, it's easy to see why a wide range of people, from students to building design experts, have flocked to help Wilson realize his dream. Though he looks like a prototype nerd -- with thick glasses, an Oscar the Grouch baseball hat, and an overall Pee Wee Herman style about him, he's engaging, funny, and charismatic. He's also passionate about helping people understand that less can very much be more.\nHere's the thing, he'll argue: An average load of laundry uses 40 gallons of water. Toasters are incredible power hogs. Air conditioning is both inefficient and bad for the environment. And just think about all the waste Americans generate every day.\nMore adventures from Road Trip 2014\nCheck out the latest from Daniel's trip to the best tech spots in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and more.\nHow Air Force One's communications are 'hardened'\nChasing drug-laden 'bogeys' across the skies\nWhen they say fly, wanna-be Navy pilots say 'how high?'\nThis robot can take the weight off soldiers' shoulders\nRoad Trip 2014 roundup\nFollow Dan on Twitter\nWith the Dumpster Project, Wilson and his team want to show it's possible to live comfortably and safely with far less impact on the environment. Personally, though, he's taking it even further than most: He wants to show it's possible to have a home in the middle of a major American city using just 1 percent of the energy and water as does the average household.\nFew would recognize Wilson's home -- which he tries to sleep in as much as six times a week, taking nights off when he's got his daughter, or when he stays over at his girlfriend's -- as offering the kinds of comforts most of us consider normal. There's no TV. There's no sink. There's no furniture. There's not even a bathroom. There are however, a couple of LED lights, one of which is solar-powered with a built-in iPhone charger.\nWilson doesn't try to deny that he's able to pursue this project because his (huge) university office, complete with air conditioning, an iMac, and several comfy chairs, is about 100 yards away, and because the school also has bathrooms and other services of which he avails himself. He also frequently spends time in nearby hotel lobbies reading and even napping, and he gets his drinking and cooking water by pulling a 24-gallon barrel known as a Hippo Roller, an hour each way to Lady Bird Lake.\nYet the point is still relevant: He sleeps most nights in the dumpster, wakes up, makes coffee, and spends a whole lot more time in it than you'd think was possible. \"I spend as much time in here as I would in my normal home,\" Wilson said, adding that \"I'm a homeowner in Austin, and I have the shortest commute in Austin.\"\nPart of his commitment to the project stems from the fact that there's a lot of people who have been inspired by it, mostly kids. He's been giving about a talk a week at different schools, and the interest children have for the project is reflected in many of the amusing drawings of the dumpster he's been given, and which he now has up on the interior of the dumpster's west-facing wall.\nIn August, Professor Dumpster will also install a bit of luxury: a set of home appliances that he'll run for a few months in an attempt to establish a baseline of how much water and energy those machines -- a fridge, a washer and dryer, and others -- use. That will then be his comparison point. Of course, he'll probably have a hard time letting go of the machines.\n'It's an outlier'\nIt's clear that Huston Tillotson University is very much behind Project Dumpster, even though Wilson, who was hired only last year, didn't initially tell the school about the initiative. But the project has brought the small university -- which is older than the nearby University of Texas at Austin, but clearly in that giant school's shadow -- a lot of notoriety, despite its being so outside the norm of typical American life. \"It's an outlier, and outliers get attention,\" Wilson said. \"We would never expect anyone to be insane enough to live in a 33-square-foot dumpster.\"\nIn fact, Wilson's goals are pretty abstract. He's trying to come up with lessons on design and building dense housing that can be used in cities like Austin. He believes if he can live comfortably in a dumpster, he can help people understand how to live well in 120-square-foot studio apartments. \"You could solve a lot of transportation and energy problems\" if people lived more densely in cities, Wilson argued.\nLuckily, no one is breathing down his neck, demanding he meet preset milestones. Though Project Dumpster has an official timeline, which lays out its growth and educational expectations through 2015, he's got a lot of freedom. \"We're thoughtfully playing,\" he said, \"to where we don't have hard design deadlines or carved-in-stone blueprints for what a dumpster home would look like. It's an evolution.\"\n'I'm pretty darned happy'\nAs Wilson sits on a small bench outside the dumpster, the project's flourishing garden just a few feet away, he looks pretty content. Dressed in a khaki shirt and pants, but wearing coordinated green sneakers and the Oscar the Grouch cap, he's relaxed as he heats up water for Turkish Coffee on a small propane burner.\nI asked him what had surprised him most about his experience living in the dumpster. After thinking for a moment, he said, \"What's most surprising is I'm pretty darned happy.\"\nHe's also become an expert in sizing up any space he visits -- so when he walks into any closet or bathroom he automatically starts doing space calculations.\nThe hardest thing about the project may even have had more to do with climate than space. Americans are used to living in 72-degree environments, he said. So in the early months of living in the dumpster, he had trouble sleeping when temperatures inside rose even to 75 degrees. But gradually, as summer has begun, he's gotten comfortable as the mercury rises. Now, even when it's 81 degrees inside, he's not hot.\nYet this is Texas, and it is summer. Though it's been temperate so far, it's unlikely to stay so. Can he stick it out? \"I want to get to triple digits in here,\" Wilson said, \"before I wuss out.\"\nKeep an eye out for more behind-the-scenes stories and photo galleries as I travel throughout Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Kansas during this year's Road Trip. I'll seek out most interesting technology, military, aviation, architecture, and other destinations our country has to offer.

With the creation of this dumpster home, I was not only communicating with my students but also to broader public. Putting a comfortable home and a dirty dumpster into one gets folks talking.\u201d\nWilson expanded on the dumpster idea and moved towards a \u201cmicrounit\u201d project. Along with several other designers and innovaters, he started a company called Kasita, a startup that addresses Austin housing inequality by creating tiny, affordable housing.\nFind out what's happening in East Austinwith free, real-time updates from Patch.\nSubscribe\nKasita, a play on the Spanish word \u201ccasita,\u201d which means \u201clittle house,\u201d is what Wilson\u2019s company is using to make this company real. Wilson and his team create homes that are only 208 square feet, yet include all of the necessary amenities for the average apartment owner.\n\u201cI started thinking about the best parts of the dumpster. By living smaller and being more nimble, I was able to have freedom to move my house wherever I wanted, while also having a short term lease. I could own stuff rather than it owning me. I started thinking about what if we made something bigger than a dumpster, but made it micro. I wanted to keep it nimble enough where you could move it as you would a dumpster. I literally created a \u2019dumpster baby\u2019\u201d.\nWilson\u2019s has a stellar team to help the company grow. Elon Musk\u2019s head industrial designer at Solar City, W2 MacFab\u2019s Robert Keith, and micro-unit developer Taylor Wilson all make up Wilson\u2019s dream team, and help make the innovative project a reality.\nThe living room couch pulls out into a queen-size bed, storage units and closets are built into the walls, and a step next to the couch serves a dual purpose by also storing up to 50 pairs of shoes. The walls in the units are made of tiles that can hold speakers and shelves, and the units themselves can fit into rack structures. Each rack holds up to nine units, and you can fit one rack into an area as small as 1,000 feet.\nKasita has two lots in Downtown Austin that will be ready by 2016. By 2017, Kasita plans to expand to 10 cities across the country.\n[Photo: Kasita]\nGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

RANT WARNING!!!\n*Let the Tar & Feathers and Pitchfork-bearing commenters run me off this topic!!!*\nI watched all the videos. I went to their Facebook page.\nI get it. You\u2019re R.A.D.I.C.A.L., with a capital \u201cR\u201d. You\u2019re \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201cwack-a-doodle\u201d, \u201cBreaking out of the cardboard box and into a metal one called a Dumpster \u2122.\u201d\nI just don\u2019t know what to say. What is this experiment trying to prove? That a human being can allegedly \u201clive\u201d in 33 sq.ft.? A prison cell has at least 88 square feet and that\u2019s called \u201cinhuman\u201d by some people. I\u2019m from Chicago, home of politicians doing these sort of stunts to \u201cBe ONE with the Po\u2019 Folks!\u201d and it makes news for a while and then things return to normal. Whether it\u2019s the former Mayor Byrne moving from her Gold Coast residence to Da\u2019 Hood (Cabrini Green Housing Projects) to our current Governor Quinn who is going to live on a \u201c\u2026poor person\u2019s minimum wages for a week\u201d, I\u2019ve never been sure WHAT lasting effects these stunts create.\nAnd, if \u201cProfessor Dumpster \u2122\u201d aka Professor Jeff Wilson wasn\u2019t trying so utterly, completely, epically HARD to be Tragically Hip, I\u2019d give him at least passing credit for attempting something \u201cRadical.\u201d\nLet\u2019s do a check list of Professor Hipster\u2019s wardrobe:\n1) Indiana Jones Fedora Hat.

Final Check off of Classic Hipster Wardrobe, Check!\nWould anyone even recognize the attention-starved professor if he dressed\u2026gasp!\u2026normal? Or restricted his props to just a couple instead of the entire costume department?\nExcept for the sheer experimentation aspect of this project where the students are all \u201cYou GO!, Prof Dumpster\u201d and then bugger off to their OWN 2,500 square foot homes that their parents own, I see no value in this silliness. How much cooler would it have been for Professor Hipster to actually come up with a project that the poor and homeless would actually want to abide in until their fortune\u2019s or luck turned around? I can\u2019t imagine a single sole wanting to call this place \u201cHome\u201d.\nAs it stands, only Professor Dumpster and Oscar The Grouch prefer to LIVE in a Dumpster! pffffffffttt\u2026.\nREPLY LINK\nPaul\nSeptember 16, 2014, 6:19 pm\n\u2026or more concisely, stupidity knows no bounds.\nI agree with you Cahow. What. Is. The. Point.? That you can do it? Ok, so you can. So, on the assumption that the professor is heterosexual, does he think he could entice a member of the opposite sex to come back to his abode\u2026 and actually spend some \u201creal time\u201d there? Methinks not.\nRANT WARNING OFF. RANT WARNING OFF. RANT WARNING OFF.\nREPLY LINK\nCahow\nSeptember 16, 2014, 7:39 pm\nPaul!

Before I even began my rant, I was privately thinking, \"This man has NO LIFE outside of his students!\" He couldn't, just couldn't. Straight or gay, if you're in a relationship, NO Significant Other is going to come over for a boot knockin' in your Dumpster \u2122! (well, unless they're into total kink but that would probably involve a used Dumpster \u2122!) LOL\nThis is what I'm expecting next from Mr. Hipster Dumpster \u2122: \"Professor Living Simply in SIX SQUARE FEET!\"\nAnd what we'll all be gifted to view is the Professor living on a park bench under a Blue Tarp, extolling the virtues of \"living simply and mortgage free!\" The 6 sq.ft. comes into play because it's the 1' x 6' dimensions of the Hipster's body. \"See how easy it is to move from place to place,\" he'll crow! \"I can pick up and move anytime I want!\" (or when the Po'-Po' move his bum from the park bench!) Of course, he'll also have to have an add-on campaign about \"Look how much food is tossed into this park bin! What a waste!\", and we'll be treated to him noshing on someone's left over Panini and flat soda drink. (blech!)\nAnd since he's the Hippest of the Hipster Dumpster \u2122 Proff's, he should include several Selfies of himself, wrapped up in his keen Blue Tarp and dining upon his purloined bin 'treats'.\nI've been involved in Environmental and Global Movements since Paul Ehrlich, Ralph Nader, and Cesar Chavez and still do, to this day as do our adult children. No gimmicks, no weird outfits, just a People's Movements and Changes.

Usually, you and I are in complete accord on the homes that you list but this time, respectfully, I\u2019ll have to \u201cAgree that we\u2019ll disagree.\u201d\nAs you know better than 99% of the people who enjoy your blog, getting the message out there about not only Tiny Homes but the philosophy behind them is an uphill battle. When the American Dream has been the Picket Fenced 3-bedroom home and ones ability to buy as many things as you can stuff inside of it, Tiny Homes and their Philosophy are flying in the face of a long standing tradition and dream.\n\u201cSay What?!\u201d, say the uninitiated. \u201cYou want me to pare down what I own into what I just NEED!?\u201d Early examples of the Tiny Homes that you showcased had the bare minimum: a folding chair and folding table; a cup, bowl, and spoon; no water except for a container on the counter; crapping in a bucket, and the infamous LOFT BED, that so many older followers just can\u2019t navigate.\nBut, as your website developed, you also began showcasing Tiny and Small homes that were a Mid-Ground of Compromise: furniture that didn\u2019t fold up; a full kitchen; flush toilets and a main floor bed. THESE examples excite a great many people as a viable alternative to a 1000-2500 sq.ft. home.\nWhen the uninitiated even begin to see or think \u201cTiny\u201d can you even imagine if they ran across this Dumpster \u2122 example or worse yet, if a news service picked this article up and ran with it as a story about \u201cliving smaller\u201d? I understand that this is an experiment but as others have asked, \u201cAn experiment for WHAT?\u201d To push the boundaries on just WHERE humans can sleep? To find out that information, all you need do is travel to any large city with a homeless population and you\u2019ll find ALL the examples that you need to see Where & How Humans Sleep.\nIn my journey of obtaining 4 degrees, I\u2019ve taken many fun, exciting and challenging courses in my Uni days. (1 B.S.; 1 B.A; 2 M.S. degrees). I had plenty of \u201cquirky\u201d professors but they were so, unintentionally. I was willing to give this Nutty Professor the benefit of the doubt until I watched the gif. of him tumbling out of the Dumpster \u2122 on Day #1. THAT\u2019S when I lost it and felt strongly that he\u2019s an attention-hungry individual. For Crissake, he\u2019s a DEAN and Professor of Something related to design, and the Dude can\u2019t figure out that he needs a ladder to exit the Dumpster \u2122 which is strategically placed askew on the concrete pad for maximum drop?!?!\nI fully expected that my opinion of how he\u2019s trying to buck the established way of thinking of Home would be unpopular. But, I feel that for all his grandstanding and publicity over this silly project, had he taken a more useful approach to solving housing issues, he\u2019d win over a far larger audience of converts to Tiny Living, not Tiny Dumpster \u2122 Living.\nI do appreciate your opinion in the matter, Alex. \ud83d\ude00\nREPLY LINK\nJeff\nSeptember 17, 2014, 11:11 pm\nI think that there is much that you don\u2019t understand about human life. One billion people on this planet are squatters and would take something strong and solid like this dumpster in a heartbeat. One Italian proverb summarizes the fact that you can\u2019t get out of your own head: A well-fed man does not believe in hunger.\nLINK\nGetTheJobDoneRight\nOctober 5, 2014, 10:28 am\nYou\u2019re new here, right?\nREPLY LINK\nBrian\nSeptember 16, 2014, 4:11 pm\nWhat a fantastic project with some superb ideas.

Over all, I think the idea is genius!! and though pretty small, it would be a place a homeless person could call their own, stay out of the elements and be safe. Many don\u2019t want any more responsibility than that so why give it to them? I\u2019ve seen the shows where well meaning organizations have fixed up an apartment or home and gave it to a homeless person and within a short amount of time, it\u2019s trashed, neglected\u2026..because they don\u2019t want the responsibility!!! Listen to what they want and then make them WORK FOR it. Then they will take care of it!

Of course he\u2019s quirky, how could he not be to do this. I had plenty of professors who were brilliant but had their own \u2018style\u2019. It\u2019s kind of expected.\nWhat impressed me was the involvement of so many students & townspeople.\nThis is an experiment for 1 year. He doesn\u2019t plan to live there any longer than that as he has a perfectly beautiful home.\nCollege is a learning ground & he is teaching in an unconventional way. Who knows what ideas may come about as a result of this.\nAt any rate. He seems to be enjoying it.\nAnd he probably has much more to think about than whether he\u2019ll get laid in that. Geez\nREPLY LINK\nCahow\nSeptember 16, 2014, 10:45 pm\nYes, he DOES have a perfectly beautiful home that can\u2019t even qualify as one of Alex\u2019s largest Tiny Homes. And I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll enjoy the hot running water, air conditioning, flush toilet and all the other environment destroying devices in it that some people rage against.\nEven the very twin ferns at his front door bespeak wastefulness; just imagine how much precious water they suck up when he could be growing some actual FOOD PLANTS on his front porch! And then donating the extra food to a homeless shelter! Tsk-Tsk. <that paragraph was said with snark, by the way. I like ferns. \ud83d\ude09\nOh, and in a year's time, if he HASN'T thought about getting laid, then that's another topic for discussion! LOL\nREPLY LINK\nAlex\nSeptember 17, 2014, 9:06 am\nI\u2019m with ya Cosy. I\u2019m not quirky or have that kind of style but I\u2019m definitely not against it and it doesn\u2019t even bother me one bit. Seems like he\u2019s having fun, is happy, and is doing the same for those around him. So I say cheers to that.\nREPLY LINK\nTom\nSeptember 17, 2014, 6:54 am\nI\u2019ve read a lot of the comments and I\u2019m amazed at how many people actually like this idea. I love tiny houses and the ideas that spring from them but this idea seems more like an attention getting spoof. I just don\u2019t get it. I\u2019m also concerned about the stability of stacked dumpsters. I hope they are stable. Not judging just a little dumbfounded.\nREPLY LINK\nAlex\nSeptember 17, 2014, 9:10 am\nI understand you\u2019re thinking. I think he\u2019s just having fun, getting others to have fun and think differently, and cure the boredom of everyday normal life. That\u2019s what I think. But either way, I just like what he\u2019s doing and wanted to share it. It\u2019s extreme, yes. And probably not too great of a solution for most. But maybe it is to some?? Who knows.\nREPLY LINK\nAndrew Coyne\nSeptember 17, 2014, 8:26 am\nHello-\nCan you give me the name and source for the rolling water barrel that is visible in the video?

Thanks!\nREPLY LINK\nAlex\nSeptember 17, 2014, 8:51 am\nHi Andrew- good question. I believe it\u2019s called the Hippo Water Roller. Here\u2019s the link: http://www.hipporoller.org/ But there are others too. Like the WaterWheel: http://wellowater.org/the-waterwheel/ And the Q Drum: http://www.qdrum.co.za/\nREPLY LINK\nalice h\nSeptember 17, 2014, 11:57 am\nInteresting water rolling containers but they all seem to be missing something durable to roll on besides the actual plastic container itself. Much more sensible to have a rubber tire like coating that can take the abuse. There is also a lot more resistance trying to roll a big lump of a thing than a well constructed cart with sturdy wheels. If you use 5 gallon water jugs in a cart they\u2019re a lot more easily handled and can be cleaned and filled in more places. Do a search on folding dock carts. They also have the advantage of being useful for more than one purpose.\nI\u2019ve gone from using 5 gallon jugs to the 2 1/2 gallon ones because they\u2019re easier to lift and can be filled at a kitchen sink if need be. 2 or 3 can be stacked on a folding luggage rack but be wary of the kind where the wheels stick out way behind, they tend to get hung up on stairs and whatnot.\nREPLY LINK\nMike\nSeptember 18, 2014, 4:45 pm\nMy first reaction was that a garbage can is not that creative of an idea. Like a few have mention, plenty of people have been doing it for a very long time. But aside from the goofy professor and animated videos I think this idea has some merit that isn\u2019t being discussed enough.\nFirst steel is waterproof, or can be made to be so . It\u2019s durable and can be made without using a framework . It can be secured pretty well and offer a relatively safe place for people.\nSteel has no off-gassing so there\u2019s nothing there or under there to be concerned with, except the paint. It can be cleaned fairly easily and doesnt absorb odors. These units can be stacked or built side by side so that a family can more easily occupy one, or as apartments where scaffolding could be used to reach the upper levels. Stacking is not ideal for people, but is possible.\nSteel is a terrible insulator but it could be insulated on the exterior with styrofoam board or layers of cardboard, or on the interior with carpet foam or just plain blankets. Keeping it warm would probably easier than keeping it cool. Perhaps some interchangeable panels could be used on the exterior for sunlight absorption or reflection/insulation.\nThe one thing I would definitely change is to make the entrance bigger for easier access.\nThe attraction of the dumpster design is it\u2019s simplicity. I\u2019ve been studying tiny homes for over a year and find that building them takes a lot of effort, time, and money. Steel containers are straight-forward and a lot simpler to construct -saving labor. But if the two could be merged, there might be a way to mass produce something that is durable and completely recyclable.\nREPLY LINK\nDenise\nSeptember 20, 2014, 12:00 am\nThis guy is blissfully nuts. I just hope the local garbage truck doesn\u2019t come by, pick up his new home and dump all it\u2019s contents, including him into the back chute. Otherwise we will be reading about him in the paper or on the national news and it won\u2019t be because he made a tiny house out of a dumpster. \ud83d\ude42\nREPLY LINK\nAlex\nSeptember 20, 2014, 10:40 am\nBlissfully nuts, lol, love that\nREPLY LINK\nMichael J. Beninate\nSeptember 21, 2014, 5:32 pm\nToo many of you are missing the point about the dumpster house. It is a stunt. It is an experiment. It is designed to get attention and is being promoted to get attention.\nAs an experiment it can fail. They want to find out if a person can live a happy life within this small dumpster space. What has been learned already is that the answer is no. Look at the additions and the planned expansion of it. That is an indication that thirty-three square feet isn\u2019t enough for what they want to have in the small living quarters.\nThirty-three square feet is plenty of space for just sleeping and having a closet. It isn\u2019t big enough for a shower, toilet, kitchen, and the other things homes have. What this experiment will eventually do is develop an idea of how much square footage is actually needed for a single person to live comfortably.\nAnybody who has spent time on this site will see that the original Tumbleweed homes made living easy in as little as eighty-four square feet with a loft that added more square feet. The Tumbleweed XS was sixty-five square feet plus a loft. They don\u2019t advertise that model anymore but they will sell the plans for it.\nThe back of a full size old style American van is between ten feet and twelve feet long. The back of a minivan is eight feet long behind the front seats. They are about five feet wide. That equals forty square feet of floor space. The big difference is that standing in a van isn\u2019t possible without a very high roof added.\nLiving in a minivan would seem like a better choice than a dumpster size box even though it is possible to stand in the dumpster.\nREPLY LINK\nChelsea\nNovember 27, 2017, 5:28 pm\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQTVuRrZO8w\nAfter watching above YouTube video \u2013 kudos to the professor for this gigantic micro idea.

He also has a light bulb, one of the first improvements he made to the dumpster.\nIn the fall, he plans to add insulation, which presents an engineering problem: how to fit four inches of insulation into a 33-square-foot dumpster without losing too much wall space.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\nThe dumpster has no shower or toilet. Wilson said he may convert a wall into an extendable washroom section which could be retracted when not in use.\nFor now, he uses the university\u2019s washrooms.\nThe dumpster has cellphone service, even when the top is closed, and will also soon have an Internet connection.\nWilson keeps just a handful of personal belongings and a few pairs of pants, shirts and shoes.\nOver the last week, he also radically reduced his bow tie wardrobe, cutting it in half after reading an article in The Atlantic in which he was quoted talking about his \u201ceight or nine\u201d bow ties.\n\u201cI realized that was kind of an excess,\u201d Wilson said.\nHe has also been discarding items with only sentimental value, starting with old photos \u2014 he now has digital copies \u2014 and trinkets like a piece of jade jewelry he gave a friend with the caveat he may ask for it back.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\nGetting rid of those objects was the \u201chardest thing,\u201d he said, adding that decluttering his physical space has simplified his life. \u201cI\u2019m a lot happier in my current state than I was in my previous state, with all the stuff and all the space,\u201d he said.\nWhen Wilson is out of town or not sleeping in the dumpster, his students often stay over. Many have re-evaluated how much space and stuff they actually need, he said.\n\u201cWe want our students having these conversations in their heads, and we want to spark a conversation on campus and in society,\u201d he said.\nWilson isn\u2019t suggesting everyone live in such a tiny space but hopes to show it\u2019s possible to have a \u201cpretty good life\u201d with very little.\n\u201cI like to call the dumpster a conversation box,\u201d he said.\nIn Toronto, two detached homes cannot be situated on the same lot, and past projects to build laneway housing have needed special zoning amendments.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\nOther cities, like Vancouver, have embraced laneway housing as a way to provide additional housing at a reduced cost and with a smaller environmental footprint.\nBobbi Kyle, a designer and master\u2019s student in Vancouver, lives in a 250-square-foot converted garage behind a home in the city\u2019s West Side.\nIt\u2019s seven times larger than Wilson\u2019s dumpster, but about an eighth of the size of the average 1,900-square-foot Canadian home.\nThe home is the most affordable Kyle has rented, and she likes the simplicity of small living. \u201cI just have what I need, and that\u2019s it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIn many ways we attach our past to objects and artifacts of living. The less of these that you keep the less you inadvertently dwell on the past,\u201d Kyle explained.\nBeing forced to buy food and supplies regularly but in small amounts \u2014 she can\u2019t store much inside \u2014 has cut her household waste production, she said.\nKyle said she also finds herself exploring her neighbourhood more.\nBut the small space has forced changes to her relationships and lifestyle.\n\u201cI\u2019m less social in some ways. There\u2019s a risk of isolating oneself in a space like this,\u201d Kyle said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your space, but you either have to go out or be in. You can\u2019t entertain, because it\u2019s too small. You\u2019re either an introvert or an extrovert \u2014 there\u2019s no medium.\u201d\nA busy student, Kyle said she enjoys the solitude but wouldn\u2019t recommend it for everyone.\n\u201cIt requires a certain amount of discipline, or someone who is really Spartan in their way of living,\u201d she said.\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\nAs an undergraduate student at Emily Carr University of Art and Design in Vancouver, she worked on a project to design a 90-square-foot apartment.\nLiving in a space that small might be practical for a short time but requires drastic lifestyle changes, she said.\nFor Kyle, about 200 square feet seems to be the minimum amount of space needed to feel comfortable, she said.\nShe has no plans to scale up her housing. For now, neither does Wilson.\n\u201cI may wake up one morning and say, \u2018What the hell am I doing? I want all of my stuff back and I want to live in a 2,000-square-foot place,\u2019 \u201d the professor said.\nAfter the dumpster project, Wilson said he\u2019s considering trying to build the smallest legal home in Austin. The city\u2019s building code is more suited to large dwellings, and building a tiny home would require some legal manoeuvring, he said.\n\u201cMy girlfriend is betting that I\u2019m not going to move into any kind of normal living arrangement after this is done,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s probably right.\u201d\nRiley Sparks\nRiley Sparks is a former Toronto Star staff reporter.\nREPORT AN ERROR\nJOURNALISTIC STANDARDS\nABOUT THE STAR\nYou Might Be Interested In\nENTERTAINMENT\n'The Lion King,' 'Mamma Mia!' \u2014 the \u201990s are back onstage.

Perhaps you recycle or ride a bicycle to work instead of taking the car to do your bit but would you consider moving into a dumpster for a year? That is just what Dr Jeff Wilson from the Huston-Tillotson University decided to do; take an old dumpster, transform it and then live in it for a whole year.\n[Image Source: Dumpster Project]\nProject Dumpster aims to investigate sustainable living practices as the population is forever increasing while space and resources are decreasing. The dumpster chosen for the project is 33 square feet and Dr Wilson says that it should make people consider what can be done with less space. He hopes that the project will encourage people to talk about it along with bringing out other ideas on the topic.\n[Image Source: Dumpster Project]\nOf course as he is going to live in it for a year, he had to make sure that there would be enough living space and so, many modifications were made to it. The dumpster has been prepared firstly by being cleaned out thoroughly and then rust proofed. In order for it to offer some degree of warmth it needed insulation and then thought was given to hanging a clothes line for drying clothes along with making a rain garden.\n[Image Source: Dumpster Project]\nOf course there was the essential installation of a toilet and a false floor was added into the box for storage. Solar panels provide sustainable electrical energy which of course doesn\u2019t come with the monthly bill. The \u201csmall home\u201d was also given a weather station, air conditioning, pitched roof, its own mailbox and locks. The pockets of the dumpster were sealed to ensure that it could not be mistaken for a trash receptacle that was in use.\nRECOMMENDED ARTICLES\n[Image Source: Dumpster Project]\nWilson also provided the interior with some furnishings. He moved into his new home in February of this year and he will be living in it for a year at least.\n[Image Source: Dumpster Project]\n0\nCOMMENT\nNEWSLETTER\nThe Blueprint Daily\nStay up-to-date on engineering, tech, space, and science news with The Blueprint.\nMail Me\nBy clicking sign up, you confirm that you accept this site's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy\nABOUT THE EDITOR\nInteresting Engineering Interesting Engineering is a diverse group of journalists, videographers, and creators that aims to help the world better understand the art and science of engineering.

Wilson is documenting his progress on the website dumpsterproject.org, using videos and social media to showcase his sustainable living project.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just to explore the idea of less,\u201d he told ABC station KTRK in Houston.\nStudents, who helped clean the Dumpster before Wilson moved in, were stunned when he announced his plan.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at all,\u201d student Charles Deshaw said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re really going to live in a Dumpster?\u2019\u201d\nThe front door slides shut. It\u2019s cold at night. The walls contain decorative hangings. The home features few appliances such as a washer and dryer, which were added during the current phase of his project. The third and final phase will feature solar panels with a focus on renewable energy.\nFor Wilson \u2014 who goes by the nickname \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d \u2014 the second night in the Dumpster was scariest.\n\u201cThe trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors,\u201d Wilson told KTRK.\nLuckily, Wilson\u2019s new home remained untouched by trash crews. After living in the Dumpster for six months, Wilson is proud of the discourse his experiment has encouraged and that it has promoted the idea of living with less.\nIt\u2019s important to \u201cfoster a conversation and keep that conversation going. We don\u2019t know where that conversation is going to lead,\u201d Wilson told KTRK.\nFollow @ABCNewsRadio\nCopyright 2014 ABC News Radio\nSUBMIT A CORRECTION\nSupport local journalism\nWe hope you appreciated this story.

It was scant living at first, with water being lugged up all the way from the local lake every few days. But things progressed quickly, and just yesterday, Prof Wilson gave the shell\u2019s interior a lick of paint, and picked a \u201cfull selection of ripe and sweet baby tomatoes, collard greens, okra and various herbs\u201d from the so-called Dumpster Garden.\nPhase two and three of the design will see a shower, toilet, multiple stories, and appliances like a washing machine, dryer, and a hot water heater introduced, all of which will use 1 per cent of the energy an average American home uses.\nMore: See the latest floor plans here\nRead More\nRead next\nSPONSORED\nMalaysia steps up pro-Palestinian stance, straining ties with U.S.\nNIKKEI ASIA\nSPONSORED\nThe Average IQ in Singapore is 108.

Her bae, environmental science professor Jeff Wilson, has taken upon himself the name Professor Dumpster and spent the last year living in a dumpster that he and his students have slowly been converting into a slightly more livable dumpster. This week, in Salon, she answers the most pressing question underpinning this innovative experiment in adaptive reuse and pared-down living: what's it like to \"fool around\" in there?\nWhat it's like to \"fool around\" in there is \"more complicated than it used to be\":\n\"When it comes to privacy, our choices are often limited to the occasional house visit and the dumpster, which is usually parked a few feet behind the women's residence hall. We regularly get asked if we've done the deed in the dumpster. For the sake of Jeff's position, all I'm at liberty to say is discreet passion is (almost) impossible in a thin metal box where one careless sigh can inform the entire neighborhood on the finer points of our recreational activity.\" Discreet passion: almost, but not quite impossible within a tricked-out garbage receptacle. Professor Jeff Dumpster also spends the rare night at her house, but he \"feels guilty\" there, \"almost like he's cheating.\" He doesn't even keep a spare tootbrush there. (What's up with THAT, Jeff??)\nBensen allows that their setup is \"one of the more peculiar ones around,\" but it stays \"vibrant and loving\u2014due, in no small part, to the fact that we're flexible and we welcome the strange and curious. We still want each other after all these wild months. We're still slow to say goodnight.\"\nPresumably, this is because of mushy gushy prolonged goodbyes, and not because Bensen has to \"channel a chimpanzee\" to enter or exit her boyfriend's house. In any case, hats off to these crazy young lovebirds.\n\u00b7 My boyfriend lives in a dumpster [Salon]\n\u00b7 'Prof. Dumpster' Will Teach Your Kids to Live in a Garbage Bin [Curbed National]\nNEXT UP IN TINY HOMES\nfrom Curbed LA Tiny 1920s Bungalow Near Dodger Stadium Asks $699K\n5 cool prefab backyard sheds you can buy right now\nGorgeous tiny house oasis built for paradise\nOff-grid circular tiny home available for preorder\n5 cool prefab backyard sheds you can buy right now\nfrom Curbed Boston South End studio asks $430,000 for its 295 square feet\nTerms of Use Privacy Notice Cookie Policy Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Info Licensing FAQ Accessibility Platform Status\nContact Send Us a Tip Community Guidelines Masthead About Curbed Newsletters Editorial Ethics and Guidelines\nVox Media Vox Media logo.\nAdvertise with us\nJobs @ Vox Media\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

What about a 33 square foot dumpster? Well, one Huston-Tillotson University professor is about to do just that. Professor Dumpster (you may know him by his given name Dr. Jeff Wilson), is a Harvard and University of Canterbury-educated environmental science professor who has decided to live in a dumpster for a whole calendar year.\nBeginning this fall, Professor Dumpster will take up residence in the customized trash bin in order to spread awareness about sustainability and promote the model of \"less is more.\" After posting on Facebook that he was selling everything he owned for a single dollar (we wish we had seen that status update), Wilson moved into his office at HT to begin the process of lessening his environmental impact and living on a smaller scale.\nBeginning this fall, Professor Dumpster will take up residence in the customized trash bin in order to spread awareness about sustainability and promote the model of \"less is more.\"\nBut this isn't just a story about living in a dumpster. Professor Dumpster is after all a teacher, and this year-long experiment is a chance for his students to design, build and test the bin with the goal of taking it from a garbage can to a home. \u201cThe idea here is to ultimately show one can have a pretty good life in a dumpster,\" Wilson told Fast Company.\nThe first phase of the project is to outfit the tiny space to have many of the creature comforts of a modern home: shower, kitchen, bed, WiFi and toilet. After that, the goal is to design the space to be as energy efficient as possible in order to reduce its environmental impact (think things like solar panels and energy producing toilets).\nFor times when the professor just needs to get out of the trash can, students can opt to stay overnight in the dumpster. As one HT student told KVUE, she's already excited to spend a night in the bin. \"I think it's pretty intriguing,\" said Evette Jackson. \"It's pretty cool. I want to live in it too.\"\nAfter his year of living in 6 feet by 6 feet is up, Wilson plans on taking the bin across the country to teach students about the possibility of living outside the box while living, well, inside a box.\nYou can follow Professor Dumpsters latest adventures on The Dumpster Project blog.\nLEADING THE WAY\nCultureMap founder David Gow to lead Houston policy nonprofit\nBy Natalie Harms, InnovationMapAug 7, 2024 | 5:03 pm\nDavid Gow will begin his new role in September. Photo by Daniel Ortiz\nA nonprofit organization dedicated to leading Houston into the future has named its next leader.\nThe Center for Houston\u2019s Future named David Gow as president and CEO, succeeding Brett Perlman, who was announced in April to be remaining at the Center with a focus on the Center\u2019s hydrogen initiative. Gow is the founder and chairman of Gow Media, CultureMap's parent company. His role is effective September 3.\n\u201cI am excited to step into this opportunity with the Center and work with the team, the board and many other stakeholders to help shape Houston\u2019s future,\u201d Gow said in a statement. \u201cThe Center presents an exciting opportunity to cast a vision for our region and identify initiatives that will make an impact.\u201d\nGow \u2014 whose portfolio includes CultureMap, its sister sites, and ESPN Radio's Houston affiliate \u2014 is a board member of Goose Capital and chair of MSAI, an entity he formed through a SPAC acquisition. Before he founded Gow Media, he served as CFO and CEO of online watch retailer Ashford.com. Prior to Ashford, Gow was director of corporate strategy at Compaq Computers and a consultant at McKinsey & Co. He received his master\u2019s in public policy from Harvard and his bachelor's in economics from Williams College.\n\u201cDavid\u2019s portfolio of experiences and skills, record of innovation and success, and deep commitment to the Houston community make him the perfect fit to lead the Center as we chart and execute on our next set of initiatives focused on ensuring a bright future for all residents in the Houston region,\u201d adds Center for Houston\u2019s Future Board Chair Cindy Yeilding.\nIn his new role, Gow will lead the Center\u2019s next effort, Vision 2050, which plans to identify the city's key issues, gaps, and opportunities.\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement also reflects the success of the Center\u2019s clean hydrogen program,\u201d Yeilding continues. \u201cOn behalf of the Center\u2019s board, I\u2019d also like to recognize Brett for launching and building such a successful and important effort as well as his overall leadership and record of achievement at the Center these past seven years.\u201d\n----\nThis article first appeared on our sister site InnovationMap.\nCULTUREMAP EMAILS ARE AWESOME\nGet Austin intel delivered daily.\npromoted series\nVisit El Paso\nExplore art, history, nature + more at these 10 awesome El Paso museums\nSoak up the sun with a breezy getaway to historic and outdoorsy El Paso",

Could you live in a dumpster?\nDr. Jeff Wilson, sometimes affectionately called \u201cProfessor Dumpster,\u201d is dean of the University College and associate professor of Biological Sciences at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, and his Dumpster Project has already proven that the answer to both questions is \u201cyes.\u201d\nWhat I should have specified when I asked the second question is that the dumpster you\u2019d be living in would be pretty nice inside, like a tiny apartment. Just with no kitchen or toilet or shower\u2026yet. Still, it would be a first-class receptacle. Way better than most. In fact, there wouldn\u2019t be much actual trash even in the thing, unless you finished off a bag of chips in there or something. And you\u2019d never have to worry about any guys in a big truck coming to pour you out in the morning.\nSo what do you think now? Could you live in such a dumpster as this, which is only entering Phase II of its development? Phase III, \u201cThe \u00dcber Dumpster,\u201d will be less like a dumpster and more like just a really small home. It will also be yet another innovative model of sustainable living\u2014something to be proud of, even if there\u2019s no room to have a couch in there too.\nWhen humans have to do things because they feel they\u2019ve got no viable other choices, they find that they can live through some pretty extreme extremes. Consider, for instance, all the homeless people in the world who have little more than a newspaper to cover them. Compared to the worst of their sleeping situations, life in a dumpster the way Dr. Jeff Wilson does it is clearly doable.\nAs a kid, I was a lover of fort-building. I made them small because I didn\u2019t have all day. I wanted to be done before the woods were too dark for me to enjoy my new stronghold. And once I\u2019d built a fort, whether out of old junk and plywood or just by expanding an already-existing ditch and covering it with sticks and grass, I usually just moved on to the next. I wasn\u2019t actually trying to live in these things, though I know that the idea of living in them \u2014 the idea that I might at least spend a night in one \u2014 was part of the fun I got out of building them. Such an idea may even be tied to evolutionary drives concerning habitat and offspring.\nNow that I\u2019m older, I\u2019m sure I still wouldn\u2019t mind building a fort every now and then, but the dream would probably be to have more of a Batcave, as in Batman\u2019s Batcave. As in, I would be Batman, the Dark Knight, in my Batcave. Silly, I know. I also know that I don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d a Batcave. I want one. And I\u2019m not the only person who does.\nThe cities and suburbs of the future will have to change to accommodate a lot more people, a lot more people wanting \u201cBatcaves.\u201d Technology will find plenty of ways to get us what we want as well as what we need, but if the goal of the world is to provide a pleasant, sustainable future for all of its humans, then a bigger focus \u2014 at least at first \u2014 should probably be put on the needs of everybody rather than the wants of a few.\nThe website for The Dumpster Project asks these two questions right up front: \u201cWhat does home look like in a world of 10 billion people? How do we equip current and future generations with the tools they need for sustainable living practices?\u201d The project is working toward answers for these questions. And, though I still wouldn\u2019t mind having a Batcave, I know that we humans could do a lot worse than following the progress and practices of Professor Dumpster.\nCategories: Love, Love Nature Tags: Austin, Batman, Dr. Jeff Wilson, environment, environmentalism, environmentalists, Huston-Tillotson University, off the grid, Professor Dumpster, solar, sustainability, texas, the Batcave, The Dark Knight, The Dumpster Project, The Uber Dumpster, tiny houses, zero-energy homes\nPost navigation\nMeet Kylie Simonds and Her Chemo Backpack\nSpeaking Up Against Domestic Violence\nLeave a Reply\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\nCopyright \u00a9 Germ Magazine 2024\nAll Rights Reserved | Magpaper by Theme Palace",

Wilson officially moved out on Feb. 4 after successfully completing his sustainable and minimalist experiment. But that\u2019s not the end for \u201cProfessor Dumpster.\u201d Here, in a follow-up interview, he talks about his experiences living in the dumpster, his new eyebrow-raising project and more.\nWhat are the top three things you took away from the experience of living in a dumpster?\nOne would be the joy that spending more time engaging with the community around you brings into your life. When you live in such a small space, it\u2019s not super comfortable all the time, so I just spent more time around campus\u2014I spent more time walking around the community interacting with folks, not cooped up in my home. The second was all of the benefits of living in a smaller space. I can name them for hours, but things like lower rent, living in the area you would like to live in, lower utilities, less time spent cleaning the house, all of those things you just take as givens. When you really compress the stuff that you have and the space that you have, you\u2019re able to cut out a lot of the noise. It\u2019s also just kind of keeping life interesting, keeping you on your toes. With a radical personal experiment like this you really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and it\u2019s pretty rare these days that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. We get a few curveballs along the way, but for a middle-aged man like myself, most stuff is generally mapped out. It\u2019s nice to have some magic. It\u2019s nice to have some surprises.\nDid you feel sad or relieved when you moved out?\nI cried like a baby. I seriously did, I have it on video. They were real tears. It really was my home.\nYou said the highest temp in the dumpster was 130 degrees and the lowest was 23 degrees. How did you deal with the elements?\nI got used to the conditions; you just don\u2019t spend as much time in there in the middle of the day. Sleeping through there in the night is easier to do in the cold if you have the right technology; I was always able to have a warm sleeping bag. Right before I got the A/C in August I had this sad little fan from Wal-Mart that ran on double A batteries. I would put next to my face and sleep under a mosquito net, so it was pretty miserable.\nNow that you\u2019ve moved out, what\u2019s going to happen to the dumpster?\nI want to be very clear that it\u2019s not actually the end of the project. I\u2019m no longer living in the dumpster, but it\u2019s now a place for educators to come to inspire their students. They come and spend the night, or sometimes more than one night, in the dumpster, and we give them curriculum and things to take back to the classroom. We\u2019ve already had an elementary school principal, a capstone teacher from a high school and a superintendent from Dallas signed up. We\u2019re also going to be opening up an artists residency program there. We have artists stay there and work on some piece of art that has to do with sustainability, and we\u2019ll also raise money for them to stay a night in the dumpster.\nWhen does your new project, 99 Nights ATX start?\nThat starts right after SXSW. We\u2019ve already had 60 nominations, and we\u2019re trying to get to 300 by the end of South By, then develop a shortlist and start staying in homes. We\u2019re working on a few iconic type homes, but we\u2019re also in real need of regular homes. We\u2019re trying to describe what makes a house a home in Austin and all the homes in Austin aren\u2019t weird. In fact, most of them aren\u2019t, so we need more nominations for a three-bedroom, two-bath in South Austin of someone who has been living there five years. We need more submissions from places like Dove Springs and Pflugerville. Some of the submissions we\u2019ve had include an assisted living home, a few from the Austonian, the Mueller development, Westlake mansions and a homeless camp community. That\u2019s going to be a real interesting experiment, especially with types of housing that I don\u2019t think have got the attention they deserve.\nYou\u2019ve also been in the press due to your romantic, minimalistic travel OkCupid date that went viral when your now-girlfriend Clara Bensen wrote about it on Salon.com. Now she has a book about the experience coming out this fall and a movie deal. What do you think about that?\nI think it\u2019s great! I think that was just another sort of small radical personal experiment, this one happened to end up yielding a girlfriend that would stay with me through the whole year of living in a dumpster. I think it\u2019s going to be a much more introspective book, not just a rom-com about traveling around Europe. It has a lot about the existential experience of the millennial.\nWho would you pick to play you in the movie?\nIs Robert Downey Jr. too old? Yeah, maybe him. I know that Shailene Woodley has expressed interest [in the movie], too.\nSo, are you still going to call yourself Professor Dumpster?\nWell, I may have to come up with a symbol and call myself the Artist Formerly Known As Professor Dumpster. But then, of course, Prince went back to Prince. \nPopular Articles\nWhy Is Austin Dating So Cursed?\nA Major Developer\u2019s Collapse Leaves Abandoned Projects Scattered Across Austin\nThe 25 Best Tacos in Austin\n50 Great Dates in Austin\n6 Texas Beaches Just a Short Drive From Austin\nWhat\u2019s With All These Breakups in Austin?\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nCurrent Issue\nArchives\nTRENDING NOW\n1907\u2019s Chill Summer, and Other Austin Weather Records That Might Surprise You\nThe Highland Lakes Are Rising Again!

The pre-fabricated homes can be constructed in three weeks \u2014 and could go a long way toward easing the affordable housing crunch that has bedeviled much of the country.\nWith the help of former employees at Google, Elon Musk's SolarCity and Bell Helicopter, Wilson thinks he has a solution to provide homes and stackable apartments in unused pieces of land such as vacant parking lots. \"If you file for a backyard unit, it can be approved in weeks,\" says Wilson, who predicts his homes could hit the market this summer.\n\"We need to find cracks in the system rather than take a sledgehammer to it,\" he says.\nIf the reaction of consumers at Kasita's recent party at SXSW is any indication, interest is high. Hundreds patiently waited in line to get a peek at the modular home, which features a bathroom/shower, kitchen, bedroom and living room patio.\nA remote control allows dwellers to quickly change mood lighting and an entertainment system. Date mode finds Marvin Gaye's smooth voice filling the small living area. Storage space is built into steps, walls and other nooks and crannies.\nThe 21-person start-up, based here, is not only espousing the mantra that small is beautiful, but it can be environmental and profitable. Wilson says several mayors are interested in the homes, and he intends to visit California to make his pitch this month.\n\"Green is the new black,\" Wilson says.\nFollow USA TODAY's San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nAd\nLearn More\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

Jeffrey Wilson, affectionately known as Professor Dumpster, moved into a dumpster on Huston-Tillotson University campus back in March to prove to his students and the community that you can have a good life while using only 1% of the water and energy used by the average American household. (His dumpster is also 1% the size of the average home at six by six feet.)\nAt first, Wilson was essentially camping in this dumpster, getting water from the town lake, using candlelight, and storing his very few belongings in a false plywood floor. In August, he entered Phase II of the project. They were able to equip the dumpster with air conditioning just in time for Texas heat of August. In this phase, the dumpster will be hooked up to the electrical grid and afforded many amenities of the modern home such as bedding, cooking supplies, solar lighting, and an improved roof.\nPhase III, called The \u00dcber Dumpster, will kick off in Spring 2015. In this phase, the team plans to combine the best of the first two phases \u2014 using modern amenities while creating the smallest ecological footprint possible. Design ideas for Phase III include a composting toilet, solar-heated shower, and a flat screen television.\nTo keep up to date with Professor Dumpster and the HT Green is the New BlackTM student organization, check out the website.\nPosted in Industry News\nHear What Our Satisfied Customers Have to Say\n\u2039\nCompetive pricing, careful and skilled delivery and placement and removal, and on time.\nReview of , reflecting an experience on 5/8/2024 by Scott G\nGreat service.

This question came to mind as I read about Professor Jeff Wilson and The Dumpster Project. A dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, Wilson embarked on an experiment to see if it was possible to live in a 36-square-foot dumpster.\nOver time, he\u2019s gone from sleeping on cardboard mats to adding custom touches like a sliding roof and an air conditioner. He sums up his sustainability experiment this way:\n\u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I had before.\u201d\nI\u2019ve shared before the idea of living a more minimalist life, but some of those stories have focused on the concept of a number. What\u2019s the smallest number of items I can own? Professor Wilson\u2019s story made me refocus on the idea of what items do we really need?\nWhat makes this perspective so interesting is that the answer varies by individual. It\u2019s incredibly personal and, I believe, an incredibly powerful process.\nThe goal isn\u2019t to get down to a number, but to better understand why we have what we have in our lives. In many ways, it goes back to the idea of buying good, quality items and owning them for a long time. If you aren\u2019t buying everything you see in the store, it becomes much more realistic to buy durable items that we really value and would otherwise be \u201ctoo expensive.\u201d\nA friend of mine recently moved into a new home. It\u2019s a larger place than she was in before, and because she\u2019s not married and doesn\u2019t have kids, people keep asking, \u201cWhat do you need all that space for?\u201d It turns out that for her, it was about location. Homes rarely come up for sale in the area she wanted to live.\nAs a result, she jumped at the chance to buy the home, despite the greater square footage. It means more time spent cleaning, but now, she literally steps out the door and she\u2019s in nature. She\u2019s exactly where she wants to be.\nHowever, because she knows it\u2019s a real risk that she\u2019ll fill up the house if she\u2019s not careful, she\u2019s adopted a one in, one out rule. For everything new she wants to bring into the house, something old needs to go out. Some of you probably follow this rule too, and like Professor Wilson\u2019s experiment, it goes back to this idea of thoughtful consumption.\nWhat do we really need? Are we buying things thoughtfully or carelessly? I believe our willingness to look at our buying behavior can have a huge impact on whether we reach the goals that we say matter most to us. If we get busy filling up our lives with things we don\u2019t need, it\u2019s easy to get distracted. So this weekend, I have a challenge for you.\nTake a look at your possessions and identify three things you consider necessities in your life. Then, take a look around at the rest of your stuff. If you had to give up everything else you own to keep those three items, could you? Or does something else start to look more important?\nBy the end of this experiment, you\u2019ll have a much better idea of how to answer the question, \u201cWhat do I really need?\u201d\n. . .\nDid you like this article?

The self-proclaimed \"Professor Dumpster\" has been living in what he calls the \"magic boxes\" most people see as nothing more than a place to put their garbage. His motivation? With the help of his students, Wilson wants to take a new approach to the way single-family homes use their resources by maintaining his lifestyle in a sustainable 33-square-foot abode that's roughly 1 percent of the average-sized American house.\nBut his project doesn't quite end there. Over the next six months, Wilson and his team will transform the trash bin into a small version of a typical home before remodeling it to maximize sustainability with features such as solar power and a \"green toilet.\"\n\"We\u2019re going to take all of the lessons we\u2019ve learned from this about design and living in small spaces and we\u2019re going to build the tiniest home to code in the city of Austin,\" Wilson says. \"We want to develop a \u2018how to\u2019 for building the tiniest home possible.\"\nADVERTISEMENT\nCheck out some photos below.\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\nADVERTISEMENT\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\nADVERTISEMENT\n(Courtesy Jeff Wilson/Huston-Tillotson University)\nH/T to FastCo.

He has his sales pitch nailed\u2014which is pretty impressive for a former university dean and professor who used to live in a dumpster.\nWhen I ask Wilson what fundamental problem his company is solving he tells me without flinching: \u201cKasita is on the verge of disrupting the urban housing market in ways not seen in real estate and development in 150 years.\u201d Wilson\u2019s confidence may just be spot on. And perfectly timed.\nKasita Founder and CEO Jeff Wilson, a.k.a. \"Professor Dumpster\". Courtesy of Kasita\nPROMOTED\nOver the past decade my wife and I have asked each other countless times why everything else we own is completely mobile with the glaring exception of real estate. It\u2019s not an unreasonably philosophical question. Every current aspect of our personal and business lives\u2014from banking and corporate communications to reading the news or planning a vacation\u2014now runs entirely off of five mobile devices and a wireless hotspot. So why do we still sleep in a house every night with two-foot thick brick walls that hasn\u2019t moved an inch in 128 years?\nSeeing a massive, mobility-starved void in the dead center of one of the largest segments of the US economy (while living in a dumpster), Wilson is betting that his tech-stuffed, 320-square foot, portable living capsule (a.k.a. casita, or \u201csmall home\u201d) is poised to transform the fundamental concept of what real estate means to a new generation of Millennials, empty nesters, and upwardly mobile creative types (e.g., us) who are looking to trade-in their 30-year mortgage for mobility, simplicity, and financial independence.\nPassport: Explore the finest destinations and experiences around the world in the Forbes Passport newsletter.\nGet the latest news on special offers, product updates and content suggestions from Forbes and its affiliates.\nSign Up\nBy signing up, you agree to our Terms of Service, and you acknowledge our Privacy Statement.

Learn how to find the perfect rental and negotiate a lease that meets your needs.\nCourtesy of Kasita\nBroadly speaking, Wilson\u2019s Kasita falls into the architectural category of prefabricated micro housing, sharing common themes with the tiny house movement like surgically efficient use of interior space and small-scale affordability. Conceptually, Kasita is what you\u2019d end up with if you crossbred a chic, modern Airstream with a container house and nested it inside of an automated parking garage.\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nIn terms of mobility specifically, Kasita is a first of its kind. Wilson\u2019s Model One prototype, which was recently unveiled at South By Southwest, is a sleek, simplistic glass-and-steel box that can get up and go when life says it\u2019s time for a change. Each Kasita slides into an engineered steel exo-skeleton that can be built in under a week on any open lot in any city up to ten stories high (for now). If you need\u2014or want\u2014to move, your Kasita comes with you. Just power up you app, schedule your move from Austin to Chicago, and grab your duffle bag. A crane and a flatbed truck scheduled by Wilson\u2019s team will take care of the rest. Packing? Forget about it.\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nWilson\u2019s vision to provide \u201cattainable\u201d, mobile housing for people moving back downtown and revitalizing many American urban cores has come a long way in the 18 months since it started in a dumpster.\n\u201cI literally tripped out of a dumpster onto the idea for Kasita,\u201d Wilson recalls. \u201cI was an IBM product manager back in the dot com years of the late 1990s and I decided to walk out into the California desert, bury my Rolex , and find something more meaningful to do with my life. I ended up becoming a professor and eventually moving into a dumpster\u201d.\n'Professor Dumpster\" kicking back at home. Courtesy of Kasita\nIn early 2014, Wilson was an environmental studies professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin when he decided to move into a 33-square foot dumpster for a year in an exercise in urban minimalism. While still teaching full-time, Wilson\u2019s goal was to demonstrate that living small wasn\u2019t \u201cun-American\u201d; it was precisely the opposite. Wilson\u2019s decision to sell almost everything and downsize was more liberating than he ever could have imagined. Most importantly, it freed his mind to think.\n\u201cMost nights I\u2019d just stare at the dumpster ceiling,\u201d Wilson recalls, \u201cAnd one night I had the first of two \u2018a-ha\u2019 moments. The first was realizing that smaller spaces could mean better lives. My stuff didn\u2019t own me anymore. I had more income. I could pick up and move my dumpster to another great part of town any time I wanted.\u201d\nCourtesy of Kasita\nWilson\u2019s second a-ha moment was realizing that there were existing stigmas surrounding \u201cmicro housing\u201d. When you say the word \u201cpre-manufactured\u201d most people think of a mobile home, not a tech-stacked, high-design living pod. If you tell my wife a loft has a \u201cMurphy bed\u201d the answer will simply be \u201cno\u201d\u2014because no one, especially my wife, wants to spend ten minutes manually erecting a bed when they just want to go to sleep. \u201cI realized that whatever Kasita was going to be,\u201d Wilson recalls, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a dumpster. It had to be beautiful. It had to be iconic. It had to turn the concept of a home into a brand like a car or a watch.\u201d\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nWhen Wilson climbed out of his dumpster in early 2015, the first person he met with was a former Apple patent attorney, who told Wilson to surround himself with people who knew more than him. As a result, one of Wilson\u2019s first partners was an industrial designer, because he knew that he couldn\u2019t reinvent real estate through architecture alone.\n\"I told him, \u2018I want you to design an iPhone that I can live in that\u2019s like a Tesla to drive\u2019\", Wilson remembers of their first meeting. \"I want you to throw out everything you know about housing\u2014and he didn't know much\u2014and make something truly iconic.\"\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nCourtesy of Kasita\nThe result is 320 square feet of smart-home technology and voice-controlled systems (with 10' ceilings) that can fine tune your interior temperature or dim the \u201cdynamic\u201d glass at night for privacy on command. The robotic kitchen module transforms into a sleek, comfortable queen bed over a mobile app while you\u2019re on your way home\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just make Kasita \u2018smart\u2019\u201d, Wilson explains, \u201cWe wanted people to just talk to the walls.\u201d\nWilson\u2019s other goal with Kasita was to build something that could be infinitely scalable for cities and developers that are struggling to provide attainable housing. The obvious targets are cities like San Francisco and Manhattan, where the whole concept of \u201creasonable housing\u201d is a laughable economic oxymoron. Other markets include providing seasonal housing in ski towns, corporate campus housing for employees or interns (think Google ), and housing for school districts who can\u2019t attract new teachers due to high local rents. Wilson has already met with over two dozen mayors and Kasita \u201ccommunities\u201d are now in the works with developers in over a dozen US cities including Chicago, Houston, Brooklyn, San Francisco, San Diego, and Atlanta.\nCourtesy of Kasita\n\u201cIt you really think about it,\u201d Wilson says, recalling another one of his nights in the dumpster, \u201cThere\u2019s been no disruption to the way we build or how we live for the last 150 years. There\u2019s a zeitgeist now happening in how people look at this, and it\u2019s tapping into other disruptive parts of the sharing economy like Uber and Lyft as well as companies like AirBNB. The kind of model that Kasita represents hasn\u2019t even begun to tap into the changes occurring in the real estate and development space.\u201d\nSo what\u2019s it cost to buy your own Kasita? Wilson is still keeping that under wraps until this fall when the first buyers can start putting down deposits.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just put it this way,\u201d Wilson tells me, \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere between a nice and a very nice Tesla.\u201d But remember we\u2019re talking about your house here.\nFollow me on LinkedIn.

The pseudonym Professor Dumpster is based upon his role as part of 'The Dumpster Project', an educational and minimalist living experiment that transformed a trash dumpster into a fully sustainable home. Wilson lived in the dumpster over the course of the yearlong project.\nContents\nJeff wilson professor dumpster\nDr jeff wilson part 1\nKasita\nThe Dumpster Project\nNo Baggage Experiment\n99 Nights Couchsurfing Experiment\nAcademic Work\nReferences\nDr jeff wilson part 1\n\nKasita\nWilson is currently CEO and Co-Founder at the startup company Kasita. Kasita builds micro smart homes that are capable of stacking. Kasita was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies and won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award. Wilson has referred to Kasita as a holistic integrated product, rather than a house.\nThe Dumpster Project\nWilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)3 non-profit 'The Dumpster Project', a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home. The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources. The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition, but a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal. The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \"poverty tourism\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity. On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'. Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators. On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster. Wilson claims that the dumpter experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita.\nNo Baggage Experiment\nTogether with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' No Baggage, in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website. New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones to screen write the film based on a book from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen. American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film.\n99 Nights Couchsurfing Experiment\nSubsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson, launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces. The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.\nAcademic Work\nWilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States. Wilson has authored numerous publications in the environmental science field and has received funding from the National Science Foundation.\nMore Alchetron Topics\nReferences\nJeff Wilson (professor) Wikipedia\n(Text) CC BY-SA\n\n\nSimilar\nAmityville: A New Generation\nIngrid Andersen\nDavid McLeish (rugby union)\n  About Alchetron|Terms|Privacy|Contact|Alchetron \u00a9 2024",

The professor's students have helped equip the dumpster with as many accommodations that can fit.\nWhat's really cool about this story is that students are signing up to sleep in the dumpster too. This will allow the professor to escape the confines for a night or two while his quarters are occupied by his students.\nStudents plan to place solar panels on the dumpster so that it can become energy efficient in the weeks ahead. The dumpster is nearly 1% the size of the average U.S. home, and the professor says that he will take it one day at a time to grow accustom to it's size.\nSEE PHOTOS OF DUMPSTER HERE\nFiled Under: Dumpster, Professoooor\nCategories: News\nMORE FROM HOT 107.9\nYoungsville Business Owners Searching for Individual Who Illegally Filled Up Their Dumpster\nYoungsville Business Owners Searching for Individual Who Illegally Filled Up Their Dumpster\nResidents Concerned with Trash Overflowing from Lafayette Apartment Complex Dumpster\nResidents Concerned with Trash Overflowing from Lafayette Apartment Complex Dumpster\nWoman Is Caught Throwing Puppies Into A Dumpster At Coachella\nWoman Is Caught Throwing Puppies Into A Dumpster At Coachella\nFEATURED\nWin a Trip to Los Angeles to Experience Billie Eilish in Concert\nWIN A TRIP TO LOS ANGELES TO EXPERIENCE BILLIE EILISH IN CONCERT\nINFORMATION\nEEO\nMarketing and Advertising Solutions\nPublic File\nNeed Assistance\nFCC Applications\nReport an Inaccuracy\nTerms\nContest Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nExercise My Data Rights\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nContact\nLafayette Business Listings\nFOLLOW US\nVisit us on Youtube\nVisit us on Facebook\nVisit us on Twitter\n2024 HOT 107.9, Townsquare Media, Inc.

As a part of an experiment and teaching lesson, Dr. Jeff Wilson lived for one year inside a dumpster. According to KSL, the East Austin man left the dumpster he called home on Wednesday, and it was not an easy departure.\nOne would think leaving a home that is just 36-square feet would be a reason to celebrate, but Wilson admitted that he shed a few tears on his last night. He spoke about how he felt this week with the local media.\n\u201cThe last few nights have been really sweet. Identitywise, am I still Professor Dumpster if I\u2019m not living in a dumpster? I don\u2019t know if this is what my mom wanted for her first-born son.\u201d\nProfessor Dumpster is the nickname he earned because of the experiment. His dumpster started off as just a plain trash can, but over the year he and his students added to it. By the end of the year, the dumpster had a \u201cwindow air-conditioning unit, storage under a false floor, a sliding roof with a weather station that takes measurements every five minutes.\u201d\nWilson even painted the walls an eggshell color, and he put up some art on the walls of the dumpster. He also had a small electric heater.\nThe dumpster Dr. Jeff Wilson called home for the last year.\nDuring the past year, he spent 250 nights inside the dumpster. The nights he spent away from it were spent with his daughter or his girlfriend at her home. Asking his girlfriend to spend the night with him for a bit of romance and breakfast in bed in the morning was out of the question.\nAt the start of the year, Wilson had a clear plan in mind. He wanted to show that people could live a \u201cpretty good life in and on a lot less.\u201d He feels like he succeeded with his experiment. Over the past year, he had \u201cmore moments\u201d with less stuff.\nThe dumpster will still have a use in the days and months to come. It will act as the center of an educational project.\nAccording to KHOU, Wilson said, \u201c[W]e are launching what we call a dumpster home school. So under that effort teachers and educators can spend a night in here. Walk home, back to the classroom with curriculum on sustainability about living on less.\u201d\nStudents will have the task of turning to the trash dumpster into a home. Students that stayed in the dumpster already did have one complaint, and that is the dumpster\u2019s weak Wi-Fi signal. Wilson hopes to change that in the future. He revealed that his dream is to have Google Fiber for the dumpster.\nDr. Jeff Wilson has already decided on his next project, and it will not involve a trash can in any way. He is moving up to homes, but the homes won\u2019t be his own. He will spend 99 nights in 99 different homes in Austin. KSL described the plan.\n\u201cThe new project, called 99 Nights ATX, will continue his exploration of the contemporary notion of house and home in Austin, in conventional and unconventional spaces \u2014 not to mention determine where he\u2019s going to live next. It helps that he has just a handful of shirts and a few pairs of shoes \u2014 enough to fit in a bag as he schleps around town, usually on his bike.\u201d\nWith this experiment, he wants to learn a \u201ccomprehensive view of the stories people tell themselves about home.\u201d\nWhat do you think of this professor\u2019s journey?\n[Photos: Professor Dumpster Instagram]\nShare this article: Professor Moving Out Of Dumpster: Texas Man Ends Experiment After One Year\nPopular On Inquisitr\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle Had an Explosive Argument and He Angrily \u2018Snapped at Her'\nMichelle and Barack Obama\u2019s Deeply Embarrassing Moment From Daughter Malia's Prom Night\nBrad Pitt Gifted Ex-wife Jennifer Aniston a $79 Million Home for Her 50th Birthday\nKris Jenner's Ex-Husband Robert Kardashian Was Allegedly Obsessed With 'Kinky' Priscilla Presley\nDonald Trump\u2019s Retort to Kamala Harris\u2019 DNC Speech Now a Running Joke on Social Media\nMore from Entertainment\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of use\nDMCA\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 The Inquisitr.

Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try,\u201d stated Dr. Seuss. The Dumpster Project asks us to do just that; think outside the box or rather in this case inside a 33-square-foot over-sized metal trash can.\nDr. Jeff Wilson, an environmental science professor and dean at Huston Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, will live in this former trash receptacle during renovation. His students, the Dumpster Team, and Wilson will transform the garbage container into a sustainable house and interactive teaching lab over the next year starting in Fall 2013.\nUpon completion, the mobile lab will tour the United States helping K-12 children understand the need for sustainability in our culture. The college students who participate in the Dumpster Project will challenge their knowledge in math, science, engineering and technology with the far reaching goal of implementing sustainability in their own life.\nCategories: Education\nMORE FROM MAJIC 93.3\nFree Movie in The Park in Texarkana on Thursday [VIDEO]\nFree Movie in The Park in Texarkana on Thursday [VIDEO]\nMan Drives Over 100 MPH To Find Bathroom\nMan Drives Over 100 MPH To Find Bathroom\nNetflix Could Be Coming To Your TV [VIDEO]\nNetflix Could Be Coming To Your TV [VIDEO]\n14 Adorable Dogs in Halloween Costumes [PICTURES]\n14 Adorable Dogs in Halloween Costumes [PICTURES]\nFour States Auto Museum Cruise Night Features Trunk or Treat\nFour States Auto Museum Cruise Night Features Trunk or Treat\nPortions Are Important To Weight Loss [VIDEO]\nPortions Are Important To Weight Loss [VIDEO]\nAnnual Veterans Day Parade Slated for November in Texarkana\nAnnual Veterans Day Parade Slated for November in Texarkana\nStudy Shows That Kisses Have Meaning [VIDEO]\nStudy Shows That Kisses Have Meaning [VIDEO]\n15 of the Shortest Celebrity Marriages in Hollywood History\n15 of the Shortest Celebrity Marriages in Hollywood History\nFEATURED\nCoyotes Spotted in Texarkana, Here's What You Need to Know\nCOYOTES SPOTTED IN TEXARKANA, HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\nINFORMATION\nEEO / Jobs\nMarketing and Advertising Solutions\nPublic File\nNeed Assistance\nFCC Applications\nReport an Inaccuracy\nTerms\nContest Rules\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility Statement\nExercise My Data Rights\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nContact\nTexarkana Business Listings\nFOLLOW US\nVisit us on Facebook\nVisit us on Twitter\n2024 Majic 93.3, Townsquare Media, Inc.

Rendering courtesy of Michael Hsu Office Of Architecture\nFew people want to think about the end of a child's life, but pediatric care is a need nonetheless \u2014 and it's an underserved one. According to Children's Respite Homes in America, as of 2023, there were only six of such homes in the United States, which makes the plans unveiled at the August 24 Abbey Lights Up COTA Gala incredibly unique.\nMichael Hsu Office Of Architecture, one of the most popular firms in Austin thanks to its work with hospitality brands like P. Terry's, Uchi, the South Congress Hotel, and many more, attended the gala to show off its first envisioning of Abbey House, one of the original goals of the Abigail E. Keller (AEK) Foundation. The first of its kind in Central Texas, Abbey House will serve as a pediatric respite and hospice facility, meaning that it will provide full-time care to children at various stages of their illness, giving family members a chance to catch up on life outside of medical settings.\nBecause there were so few examples to base the work on, the Michael Hsu team has an opportunity to create a new standard for this type of care. They worked with local specialists to combine the two main needs.\n\u201cWhat we have found is that the design has to find balance between two potentially conflicting concepts \u2013 respite and hospice,\u201d said Dr. Patrick M. Jones of Dell Children's Medical Center in a press release. He's the section chief of pediatric palliative care.\n\u201cThe teams are presented with the challenge of creating a welcoming, open space for respite, as well as cozy and private space for those navigating end of life care,\" he continued. \"Not to mention creating a facility that ensures all aspects of the building make medically fragile children feel welcome and that they belong there, past just feeling accommodated for.\"\nThere is only one public rendering available so far. It shows a large, airy room with a sloped ceiling and large windows constituting what looks like an entirely glass wall. With lots of natural wood finishes, it looks out into a calming yard enclosed by greenery, including trees and a trellis for flowers. The interior makes space for playing and reading, and mobility aids are afforded wide paths through.\n\"Our vision is to craft a serene and welcoming environment ... to provide a calming retreat for hospice families while simultaneously sparking joy and imagination in children staying for respite services\" said Michael Hsu architect Brian Carville. \"This balance of tranquility and whimsy will set a new benchmark in pediatric respite and hospice care, enriching the lives of children and their families in Texas.\u201d\nThe AEK Foundation is the annual benefactor of the gala at the Circuit of the Americas, now in its sixth year. The foundation's goal since the start was to build this facility, but in the meantime it's used incoming financial support to purchase care packages for children entering the Dell At Home hospice program, equipment for procedures at the Dell Comprehensive Care Clinic, hire specialists, and more.\nMichael Hsu Architecture got involved through its Design for All program, which selects annual nonprofit partners to receive pro bono design work. Emergency foster care shelter Central Texas Table of Grace is the partner for 2024, and AEK is the honorary partner. The gala was hosted by The Daytripper host and executive producer Chet Garner, with live music by Suede.\n\"It\u2019s important to understand the reason a facility like Abbey House is needed is that the system is not set up to support this right now,\u201d said Dr. Jones. \u201cTo overcome the barriers to open a facility like this requires a ton of work and upfront help from the community. The only way this becomes successful is if this becomes an Austin and a Texas project, not just an AEK project. It's a community task to care for the most vulnerable in our community and this Foundation is doing that work.\"\nMore information about the Abigail E.

He's still in the first phase \u2013 or the camping out portion \u2013 of his three phase project. That means no electricity as we hover around 100 degrees.\nIn October we first told you about Professor Jeff Wilson's plans to live in a dumpster for a year. Wilson moved in to his dumpster digs nearly four months later. Now 5-months into phase one of his sustainability project, Wilson is eager to show off some dumpster home amenities.\n\"We've added what you might call a crawl in closet where we've got all of our clothes and some of our bedding there,\" said Doctor Jeff Wilson. Wilson is an environmental science professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University.\nBut he's most proud of two things \u2013 the first usable garden at Huston-Tillotson in nearly 5-decades. He keeps it freshly watered with the condensation that drips from a nearby AC unit. Then it's his crowning accomplishment to date \u2013 a weather station complete with antenna.\n\"It's probably the first weather station that's been strapped to a dumpster,\" said Wilson.\nNow you would expect the weather station to be able to measure the temperature both the inside and outside the dumpster. What you might not be aware of is that it also also measures the moisture content into Wilson's garden. Talk about your ground control to Major Tom. But 5-months in a dumpster have not been without problems.\n\"That heavy rain that we had last week... when you start getting a bit more horizontal rain my basement flooded,\" said Wilson. \"I had about an inch of rain and it was time to get the Wet Vac out.\"\nAnd of course there's the heat.\n\"I have a gauge set up that I can see that fails at 120 (degrees),\" said Wilson. \"It failed the other day. I think the interior temperature the record we're up to 124 [degrees], so I don't hang out here much as you can imagine during the day during July. It has been a cool summer, but it hasn't been a cool dumpster summer.\"\nPhase two -- with electricity and AC -- begins next month.\nGo here for a link to the dumpster project website.\nClose Ad\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nAmericans in Singapore can request their ballot via email!\nAmericans living or traveling abroad are eligible to vote in the 2024 elections.

How much does a person really need?\nBy James Hamblin\nSEPTEMBER 11, 2014\nSHARE\nSAVE\nTucked behind the women\u2019s residence halls in a back corner of Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s campus in Austin, Texas, sits a green dumpster. Were it not for the sliding pitched roof and weather station perched on top, a reasonable person might dismiss the box as \u201cjust another dumpster\u201d\u2014providing this person did not encounter the dean of the University College Jeff Wilson living inside.\nProfessor Wilson went to the dumpster not just because he wished to live deliberately, and not just to teach his students about the environmental impacts  of day-to-day life, and not just to gradually transform the dumpster into \u201cthe most thoughtfully-designed, tiniest home ever constructed.\u201d Wilson\u2019s reasons are a tapestry of these things.\nUntil this summer, the green dumpster was even less descript than it is now. There was no sliding roof; Wilson kept the rain out with a tarp. He slept on cardboard mats on the floor. It was essentially, as he called it, \u201cdumpster camping.\u201d The goal was to establish a baseline experience of the dumpster without any accoutrements, before adding them incrementally.\nNot long ago, Wilson was nesting in a 2,500 square foot house. After going through a divorce (\u201cnothing related to the dumpster,\u201d he told me, unsolicited), he spun into the archetypal downsizing of a newly minted bachelor. He moved into a 500-square-foot apartment. Then he began selling clothes and furniture on Facebook for almost nothing. Now he says almost everything he owns is in his 36-square-foot dumpster, which is sanctioned and supported by the university as part of an ongoing sustainability-focused experiment called The Dumpster Project. \u201cWe could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d Wilson said at the launch, \u201c[fueled by] sunlight and surface water, and people could have a pretty good life.\u201d\nWilson, known around town as Professor Dumpster, recounted in another recent interview that he now owns four pairs of pants, four shirts, three pairs of shoes, three hats, and, in keeping with his hipsteresque aesthetic, \u201ceight or nine\u201d bow ties. (That's an exceptional bow-tie-to-shirt ownership ratio.) He keeps all of this in cubbies under a recently installed false floor, along with some camping cooking equipment.\nCustomization of the space really began in July. Wilson asked Twitter what was the first thing he needed, and the response was almost unanimous: air conditioning. In the Austin heat, the dumpster was getting up to 130 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. On some nights it did not fall below the high 80s. So on his six-month anniversary of living in a human-sized convection oven, Wilson procured a modest air conditioner.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make it too easy,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI wanted to see how elastic my sleeping habits would be relative to temperature and humidity. I found that I could actually get to sleep pretty well as long as I went to bed at about 11:00 p.m.\u201d\nWilson lectures about his home (Air Media)\nWith the weather station now strapped to the top, Wilson tracks his personal climate in real time. Pulling up data on his computer from inside his centrally cooled office as we spoke, he announced that the dumpster was currently 104 degrees. During the spring, when Austin was a little cooler, he was able to pass some daytime hours in the dumpster. With the arrival of summer, that became unbearable. \u201cBut some interesting things happened because of that,\u201d he explained. He spent a lot more time out in the community, just walking around. \u201cI almost feel like East Austin is my home and backyard,\u201c he said. He is constantly thinking about what sorts of things a person really needs in a house, and what can be more communal.\n\u201cWhat if everybody had to go to some sort of laundromat?\u201d Wilson posited. \u201cHow would that shift how we have to, or get to, interact with others? I know I have met a much wider circle of people just from going to laundromats and wandering around outside of the dumpster when I would\u2019ve been in there if I had a large flat screen and a La-Z Boy.\u201d\nPhase two, currently in progress (Jeff Wilson)\nPerks like insulation will come, allowing the small air conditioner to keep pace with the Texas sun. The second phase of The Dumpster Project, which Wilson and collaborators call the \u201caverage American dumpster studio,\u201d will incorporate more amenities including a bed, a lamp, and a classic home-evoking pitched roof that will slide back and forth to allow ventilation, weather stripping, and locks (making this possibly the only dumpster in the world with interior locks). Eventually, the dumpster will have a dome to catch rainwater and provide shade, as well as a (tiny) sink and kitchen.\n\u201cActually,\u201d he said as we spoke by phone, \u201cit is starting to rain right now, and my roof\u2019s open on the dumpster.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god.\u201d\n\u201cCan I call you right back? It\u2019s a downpour. I\u2019ll be back in about a minute.\u201d\nHe called me back a minute later, sounding less distressed than one might expect from a person whose home had been drenched. The disposition that might make a person amenable to dumpster life is not one easily troubled by a little rain. His dumpster-home once looked like this:\nThe interior of the dumpster on Wilson\u2019s first night there; emptying the rain tarp; the view through a newly installed window; storage space in the dumpster floor (Jeff Wilson; Air Media; Sarah Natsumi)\nHe\u2019s also welcoming of anyone who wants to stop by the dumpster and talk sustainability any time. In addition to teaching courses in environmental change, global health and welfare, and environmental science at the college, Wilson describes The Dumpster Project primarily as an educational initiative that just happened to dovetail with his current life-downsizing. On some nights, Wilson will stay with a friend, and students from the ecology-focused campus group Green Is the New Black will get a night to stay in the dumpster.\n\u201cWhat does home look like in a world of 10 billion people?\u201d the project\u2019s site implores, referring to the projected 40 percent increase in the human population by the end of the century. \u201cHow do we equip current and future generations with the tools they need for sustainable living practices?\u201d\nUnfortunately the site does not answer those questions in concrete terms. But with only 39 percent of Americans identifying as \u201cbelievers\u201d in global warming, just raising questions and promoting consciousness of sustainability might be a lofty enough aspiration.\nWater access (Air Media)\nWilson\u2019s most anticipated upcoming boon is a toilet. \u201cI\u2019m not as concerned about the shower,\u201d he said, \u201cbut getting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run.\u201d Currently, he uses facilities at the university\u2019s gym. A toilet and shower will soon connect to the dumpster externally. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed-up 36 square feet,\u201d he explained.\nIn four months Wilson will enter the third phase of the project, the \u201cuber dumpster home.\u201d That will involve installing solar panels and unplugging from the energy grid, as well as completing aesthetic work that will essentially remove any semblance of dumpsterdom. \u201cWe kind of want to do the outside in a modern Dwell look,\u201d he said, including windows and reused lumber siding. \u201cWe want it basically to be such that if you were blindfolded and placed inside it, you\u2019d just think you were in a very tiny house.\u201d\nPhase three, beginning this winter (Jeff Wilson)\nWilson already goes around to local elementary and middle schools recounting his experience in the context of talking about using less space, less energy, and less water, and creating less waste. There is a K\u201312 curriculum built around the dumpster experiment, and eventually the finished dumpster will be transported to these schools for display.\nFor Professor Dumpster, the undertaking is at once grand and diminutive, selfless and introspective, silly and gravely important, even dark. \u201cWe bring everything into the home these days,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to leave the home for anything, even grocery shopping, anymore. What\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home.\u201d\n\u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I had before.\u201d\nTHIS IS YOUR LAST FREE ARTICLE\nALREADY A SUBSCRIBER?\nSIGN IN\nNever miss a story from The Atlantic.\nGet unlimited access to The Atlantic.\nSUBSCRIBE NOW\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nJames Hamblin, M.D., is a former staff writer at The Atlantic.

LYNCHSEPTEMBER 29, 2014\nSince February 4th, 2014, Dr. Jeff Wilson has been living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for The Dumpster Project, an ongoing experiment in minimalist living at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin. During the course of the project, Wilson and his students will be continually upgrading the dumpster through three distinct design phases: dumpster camping, average American dumpster home, and \u00fcber dumpster. The current edition of the dumpster \u2014 phase two \u2014 features air conditioning, basic appliances and amenities, and water and power connections. The \u00fcber dumpster, which will feature a pop-up second story and a folding balcony, is expected to launch in 2015. Wilson has committed to living in the dumpster for a full year. The project can be followed on Instagram.\nphotos via The Atlantic\nvia The Atlantic\nRelated Posts\nInflato Dumpster, New York City Art Group is Transforming a Dumpster Into a Inflatable Pop-Up Community Center\nBarbie Dream Dumpster\nArtist Converts Trash Dumpster Into One Room Home\nMan Calmly Tells a Bear To Get Out of His Dumpster\nHungry Bear Wheels Away an Entire Dumpster Two Nights in a Row\nTrashcam Project, Sanitation Workers Photograph Hamburg With Dumpster Pinhole Cameras\nE.D.W.

Don\u2019t miss it!\nAbout Jeff\u2019s Initiatives\n\u201cThe best ideas often spring from unanticipated sources and Kasita is no exception. The concept emerged during Jeff Wilson\u2019s yearlong stint living in a used dumpster, a social experiment that reduced the definition of \u201chome\u201d to a 33 square foot extreme.\nWhile the dumpster was, in many ways, an impractical dwelling, there were a surprising number of perks: it could move anywhere; rent was low; commutes were short; and the local neighborhood became an intimate living room.\nAs the experiment drew to a close, Wilson took what he\u2019d learned and returned to the drawing board where Kasita came to life, a new category of home that married iconic design and pioneering technology with insights gleaned from a trashcan.\u201d\n\u2013 kasita.com\nAdd to calendar\nVENUE\nCompanion\n908 East 5th Street\nAustin, TX United States + Google Map\nSolar Austin Happy Hour: Austin Energy SHINES\nMake Stuff with Austin Creative Reuse\nCOMMON LINKS\nWho We Are\n*Join The Club*\nAdvertise With Us\nLogin to your Account\nGet In Touch\nNews Archives\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE WEEKLY COMMON\nDelivered straight to your inbox every Thursday evening/ Friday morning, The Weekly Common tells you everything you need to know for the week ahead\u2026 and all in 20 minutes or less.

He may even continue living in the dumpster for another year if he feels like continuing with the much simpler life - which he claims to prefer.\nMr Wilson, who is dean of the University College at Huston-Tillotson in Texas, USA, said the toughest part of his challenge was dealing with the temperature inside the dumpster. The heat hit 45C in the summer and reaches -5C in the winter.\nHaving now built temperature controls, though, he said he is focusing on communicating the design aspect of the project. However, managing the smells from the toilet can also be an issue.\nHe said: \u2018We hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing, energy sustainability, science education, and higher quality of life. \u2018Ultimately, the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing.\n\u2018This is an outlier experiment. The students and university, thought they thought the experiment a bit odd, have warmed to the idea, even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to.\u2019\nGovernment considers prepaid meter system to combat electricity theft\nTags: professorsetsdumpster\nRelated News\n38, including security personnel, martyred in Balochistan attacks\n36 die, over 35 injured in two bus accidents in Rawalpindi, Hub\nAt least 15 civilians killed in northern Mali drone strikes\nBangladesh thrash Pakistan to secure historic first Test victory\nTelegram CEO arrested at Paris airport\nPresident Zardari, Fazl discuss politics ahead of important ...\nTop Stories\nPM seeks plan for transfer of Pak-PWD projects to provinces\nArmed men kill 23 passengers in Musakhel\nPM orders third party validation of development projects\nCM Maryam admits security lapse after deadliest attack on Punjab ...\nTarar slams PTI for fanning politics of disruption\nGovt mulls shutting down utility stores across country\nLatest\nBeggars\u2019 influx unnerves shoppers ahead of school season in KP\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nPakistan\u2019s rare wild pheasants being pushed to the edge\n3:28 PM | AUGUST 26, 2024\nPCB appoints cricket legends as mentors for Champions Cup team\n3:23 PM | AUGUST 26, 2024\nKundi stresses role of vocational education to address unemployment\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nDI Khan vulnerable to various climate-change related effects\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nEditor's Picks\nCartoon\n  Cartoon\n  Internet disruptions in Pakistan cripple freelancers\n  Cartoon\n  Cartoon\n  Columns\nIs Rome Still Burning?\nBY NAJM US SAQIB\nAUGUST 26, 2024\n  Fintech Fortification\nBY IQRA BANO SOHAIL\nAUGUST 26, 2024\n  The Road to Integration\nBY NABA FATIMA\nAUGUST 26, 2024\n  Unrest in the UK\nBY DR QAISAR RASHID\nAUGUST 25, 2024\n  Was Haniyeh Compromised?\nBY TAZEEN AKHTAR\nAUGUST 25, 2024\n  ePaper\nBlogs\nBureaucracy in Literature: A timeless ...\nBY BISMA NOOR JATOI\nAUGUST 23, 2024\n  Inflation hike leading to spike in suicide ...\nBY ZAINAB PIRZADA\nAUGUST 08, 2024\n  Pakistan on the brink of revolution?\nBY AREEJ MUSADDAQ\nAUGUST 08, 2024\n  Why Pakistan needs to address Chinese ...\nBY AMIR MIR\nAUGUST 05, 2024\n  Why Pakistan must follow the Chinese ...\nBY AMIR MIR\nAUGUST 01, 2024\n  Cartoons\nCartoon\nAUGUST 22, 2024\nEditorials\nGlobal Tax Reform\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nProtecting Pilgrims\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nAccountability First\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nInstitutional Neglect\nAUGUST 25, 2024\nA Cautionary Tale\nAUGUST 25, 2024\nLetters\nModern Elevating Skills\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nCrime and Security Issues in Kashmore\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nJamshoro Bus Terminal\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nPoor Economy in Pakistan\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nImpacts of Climate Change\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nePaper - Nawaiwaqt\nNewsletter Subscription\n\nFollow Us\nContact Us\nNIPCO House, 4 - Shaharah e Fatima Jinnah,\nLahore, Pakistan\nTel: +92 42 36367580    |     Fax : +92 42 36367005\nAdvertise With Us Contact Us About Us Privacy Policy Copyrights\nNawaiwaqt Group | Copyright \u00a9 2024\nPowered By",

For a year, he lived in the 33-square-foot space, set in the school's parking lot.\n\nThe dumpster experiment began when Wilson, a biology professor, and others at the school renovated the structure in the style of a tiny house. Despite indoor temps that ranged from 30 to 130, he seems to have lived quite comfortably most of the time with the help of an air-conditioner, a weather station, and a false floor for clothing storage. No bathroom or shower though. Wilson says the experience taught him how to lead a simpler life.\n\n\n\nWilson's next project will be to crash on 99 couches in Austin in 99 days.\n\nVia The Washington Post.\nCOMMENTS\nHOUSES SIMPLE LIVING\nAround the Web\nWoman falls to death through rotten floorboards into 48ft well under home\nAn 83-year-old woman died Sunday while helping her daughter move out of a 100-year-old house in Salem, South Carolina.

It\u2019s not what it sounds like: Wilson is an environmental science professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, and he\u2019s working with his students and a team of experts to transform that dumpster into a sustainable home that costs under $10,000.\nHe uses the alter-ego \u201cProfessor Dumpster.\u201d\n\u201cProfessor Dumpster will be spending one year in a dumpster that is approximately 6 feet x 6 feet, or about 1% the size of the average new American home. Professor Dumpster, in his bid to become part of the \u2018new 1%\u2019 will strive to use 1% the water, 1% the energy, and create 1% the waste of the average American home,\u201d reads The Dumpster Project website.\nWe first came across Wilson over at The Atlantic, where they describe his downsizing from a 2,500-square-foot house to a 500-square-foot apartment and finally to the 36-square-foot dumpster. For reference, that\u2019s 152 square feet less than the self-proclaimed \u201cworld\u2019s smallest house\u201d in London, 204 square feet less than a typical $30,000 tiny house, and 92 square feet smaller than the tiny house in which a Business Insider reporter spent the weekend with her mom.\nWe were so intrigued by Wilson\u2019s project that we reached out to Team Dumpster to see if it had photos to share. We\u2019ve published them here with the group\u2019s permission.\nThe Dumpster Project will be completed in three phases, starting when Wilson took occupancy in February 2014: camping in a bare-bones dumpster (shown here); living in a dumpster \u201chome,\u201d with additions such as storage and a bed; and then fine-tuning the dumpster into the ultimate sustainable home.\nSign Up for the National Weekly Newsletter\nSIGN UP\nNow, the dumpster is starting to look a little more like home.\nHere, you can see its garden beds, mailbox, and sole window.\nThis photo was taken from the dumpster\u2019s sole window, which also functions as the door.\nIn the third and final stage, which hasn\u2019t yet begun, the team will continue adding to the home with a focus on making sure it uses 1% of the energy and water used in of the average American home.\nTAGS\nMicro-units\nTop stories\nALL MARKETS\nSAN FRANCISCO\nOpenAI exits San Francisco HQ after Elon Musk stops paying rent\nSOUTH FLORIDA\nBoca Raton couple siphoned over $40M from investors in a real estate fraud, SEC alleges\nSOUTH FLORIDA\nDetails, renderings revealed for billionaire Ken Griffin\u2019s $1B Miami supertall\nNATIONAL\nStarwood seeks to hold Joel Schreiber in contempt of court\nRecommended\nALL MARKETS\nCapstone Equities eyes office-to-apartment conversion in Encino\nSecond investor sues OC Ventures for $3M debt on Greektown complex\nVelocis wants mediation with oppositional suburbs Bee Cave, Lakeway\nFormer Padres owner John Moores sells Pebble Beach home for $45M\nGeyser Group scores $28.5M construction loan in East Austin\nTop stories delivered to your inbox\nFEATURED\nCOMMERCIAL\nRESIDENTIAL\nWEEKLY\nNATIONAL\nCHICAGO\nDAILY\nCHICAGO\nLOS ANGELES\nVIEW ALL NEWSLETTERS\nSIGN UP\nRecommended For You\nNEW YORK\nAUG 12, 2024\nBrandon Miller\u2019s widow lists debt-ridden Hamptons estate for $15M\nBrandon Miller\u2019s widow aims to sell the heavily-mortgaged Water Mill property that provided a dreamy backdrop for her Instagram feed.\nSOUTH FLORIDA\nAUG 24, 2024\nIsland living: Inside the world of Palm Beach\u2019s luxury agents\nFor an inside look at Palm Beach agent life, The Real Deal talked to a few top luxury real estate brokers about how they walk the walk.\nNEW YORK\nJUL 4, 2024\nDeveloper Brandon Miller in intensive care\nObituaries for developer Brandon Miller, possibly AI-generated, circulated online even though he was alive in a Southampton hospital.\nNEW YORK\nAUG 26, 2024\nShifting rates and herd mentality: How NYC traded a slow spring for a hot summer\nNew York City\u2019s residential market saw a jump in contracts and bidding wars after buyers seized on declining mortgage rates.\nNEW YORK\nAUG 23, 2024\nChelsea development stuck in limbo because Brandon Miller died without a will\nA friend who lent Brandon Miller $1.5 million is stuck in limbo because Miller apparently died without a will.\nABOUT US\nCONTACT US\nPRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nSUBSCRIBE\nCORPORATE SUBSCRIPTIONS\nADVERTISE\nHELP CENTER\nCAREERS\nSHOP\nAll rights reserved \u00a9 2024 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.\n450 West 31st Street, New York, NY 10001 Phone: 212-260-1332\nTRD AI Chatbot",

The reason for his unusual nickname? He has decided to live in a dumpster for the next year - Yes, the kind that you might find filled with trash behind a restaurant or in an alley.\nWilson says the inspiration to do something this radical first hit him two years ago, when he was working on an article at a neighborhood coffee shop and caught sight of an eight-yard dumpster. So when his apartment lease ran out a year later, the professor sold all of his possessions and spent the next seven months sleeping in his office, while he searched for a suitable trash can.\nNow that he has found one, Professor Dumpster is putting his students to work. After all, the point of this project isn't just to spend his life living out of a garbage can: there is, a much greater purpose involved. As an environmental scientist, the professor constantly ponders about sustainable living and how every person should try minimize his/her impact on our already stretched resources. That, is the challenge Wilson wanted his students to step up to, this entire year.\nUsing their math, science, engineering, and technology skills he wants them to retrofit his 33 square-foot dumpster into a modern space that includes a shower, toilet, kitchen and bed and is fitted with amenities like air-conditioning and even WiFi. The one caveat? It all has to be 'green' and sustainable.\nSome important things Wilson's students will have to consider are how to retrieve water, harness energy and keep a healthy living space. To live in this dumpster comfortably, the Professor will need filtered water for drinking, cooking, as well as, for other everyday activities like the toilet and shower. While this is not that big a deal, given that the dumpster has to be sustainable means that the used water has to be recycled as efficiently as possible. In order to ensure that the professor remains healthy there also needs to be adequate ventilation, as well as, cooling and heating systems that function efficiently, without utilizing too much energy or space.\nWhile this may sound like an impossible task, the students are stepping up to the challenge and seem to be figuring it all out. By incorporating solar panels for lighting and electricity, nano-insulation to regulate temperature, and \"energy-producing\" toilets, they plan to create a \"net zero\" model. That means that the dumpster-home will only consume as much energy as it produces. Innovative systems are also being developed for water filtration, climate control, and waste reduction, resulting in what will eventually be a comfortable living space where nothing is wasted. Meanwhile, the professor has already moved into his bare-bones home where he spends the nights 'hanging out' inside a sleeping bag on the floor - quite literally, given that he is 6'1\".\nWhen completed, Wilson's new home will boast some pretty impressive statistics - At 33 square feet the compact home will use zero electricity, just 4 gallons of water per day and apparently produce close to zero trash. In contrast, an average 2,480 square-feet American home uses about 9,500 Kilowatts of energy per month and spends 400 gallons of water and generates 4.5 pounds of trash per day!\nSo why is Wilson planning to go through such hardship? Because he wants to equip his students with the tools to survive in a world that is rapidly heading towards a population of 10 billion people. A world in which resources and space are going to be so restrained that a large majority of the population may have to adjust to living in tighter spaces.\nBy promoting awareness and education on these subjects, Wilson is helping students everywhere see that living \"small\" and sustainably is certainly possible. And while the dumpster project may seem a little melodramatic to some, the professor thinks of it as a \u201cplayful and imaginative\u201d educational experiment and conversation-starter to discuss the fact that all of us can do with less as we move into the future.\nThe scientist is of course is not planning to spend his entire life in this dumpster - Just over a year during which time he will tour the country, visiting schools and teaching kids about sustainable living. Given that the professor is planning to do that stealthily, be sure to keep an eye out and investigate if a relatively clean-looking dumpster suddenly shows up on your playground - Professor Dumpster might just be lurking inside!\nWilson is not the first person to have come up with this idea. California designer Gregory Kloehn has already refurbished a dumpster into a luxury home and now regards it his 'home away from home' for whenever he visits New York. While his may not be as sustainable as the one that the professor is planning to create, judging from the video below, it sure is cool.\nResources: dumpsterproject.org,mnn.com,grist.org,fastcoexist.com,curbed.com\nCite Article\nMLA\nChicago\nAPA\nLearn Keywords in this Article\nPlay Game\n548\nComments (548)\nPost comment\nC and C\n11 years ago\nWho would live In a dumpster?\nReply\n0 Likes\nlioness12\n11 years ago\ni wonder if he has air freshener?\nReply\n0 Likes\nlioness12\n11 years ago\ni ve heard of dumpster diving,but dumpster living???????? cool but bit exetreme.\nReply\n0 Likes\nhi\n11 years ago\nI agree we should ALL live in a dumpster\nReply\n0 Likes\nFreehawk324\n11 years ago\nIt's actually ironic how easy it would be to live in a large dumpster if you have the right supplies!\nReply\n0 Likes\nFreehawk324\n11 years ago\nThat's my dream home\nReply\n0 Likes\njojo\n11 years ago\nwe should all live in dumpster\nReply\n0 Likes\njojo\n11 years ago\nsweet\nReply\n0 Likes\nseagull soars\n11 years ago\nthis is really cool\nReply\n0 Likes\nman huoter\n11 years ago\nthat is crazy cool\nReply\n0 Likes\nShow More\nPopular Articles\nWeek\nMonth\nYear\nRare Orange Lobster Rescued By Restaurant Employee\nElephants Assign Unique \"Names\" To Each Other, Just Like Humans\nCenturies Old Preserved Fruit Unearthed At George Washington's Home\nRoman Beach Buried By Mount Vesuvius's Eruption Now Open\nScream For Ice Cream !

It's in a metal dumpster that is typically meant for trash. His experiment is attracting a lot of attention.\n\nJeff Wilson, an environmental science professor at Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is known as 'Professor Dumpster' for teaching his students how to live while making a minimal impact on the environment.\n\n\"We want to teach issues around sustainability, STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] education, living on less, to a much broader audience than you might just reach in one small environmental science class,\" said Wilson.\n\nThe course is divided into three phases, the first one being basic camping. Every day, either Wilson, one of his students or a member of the community spends a day in the dumpster.\n\n\"They use sleeping bags, filter the water from a nearby lake and wash with wet towels. For a toilet, they use bottles or the college restrooms. They also grow vegetables in a small garden,\" he said.\n\nIn the second phase they will use energy-efficient appliances, while in the last phase their \u201chome\u201d will get solar panels and a composting toilet.\n\nIn the beginning, some students were skeptical. Others say they liked the idea from the start.\n\n\u201cHe explained about the dumpster project and I told him, 'that's so weird that it's awesome.\u2019 So I got right on board,\u201d said student Angelica Erazo.\n\nWilson said three square meters is slightly more than one percent of the average new American home. He wants to see if it\u2019s possible to live with only one percent of average energy and water consumption, while creating only one percent of the average home\u2019s waste.\n\nThe experiment will last for a year, during which the residents of the tiny home will carefully track energy and water usage, as well as the amount of generated waste.\nRelated\nEagerly-awaited Technology Turns Garbage into Fuel\nAfrica Developing Unified Climate Strategy\nMore Science & Health News\nWhat is Telegram, why was its CEO arrested in Paris?\nFrance's Macron: Arrest of head of Telegram messaging app wasn't political\nChina robot conference spotlights the changing face of humanoids\nPavel Durov has nothing to hide, Telegram says of arrested founder\nChinese entities turn to Amazon cloud, rivals to access US chips, AI\nThe Day in Photos\nAugust 26, 2024\nFOLLOW US\nUNITED STATES\nUS News\nImmigration\nAll About America\nSilicon Valley & Technology\nWORLD\nAfrica\nThe Americas\nEast Asia Pacific\nEurope\nMiddle East\nSouth & Central Asia\nSECTIONS\nVOA Programs\nSpecial projects\nDay in Photos\nPress Freedom\nRefugees\nVOA News on Iran\nVOA News on China\nArts & Culture\nEconomy & Business\nHealth\nExtremism Watch\nStudent Union\n52 Documentary\nVideos\nMORE FROM VOA\nVOAAfrica.com Programs\nVOA Learning English\nPolygraph.info\nEditorials\nABOUT THIS SITE\nTerms of Use & Privacy Notice\nAbout VOA\nGet VOA+\nVOA Around the World\nContact VOA\nMedia Relations\nUsage Requests\nVOA Pronunciation Guide\nMD",

When Jeff Wilson aka Professor Dumpster spent a year living in a used dumpster, a social experiment that reduced the definition of \u201chome\u201d to a 33 square foot extreme, a concept emerged. While the dumpster was, in many ways, an impractical dwelling, there were a surprising number of perks: it could move anywhere; rent was low; commutes were short; and the local neighborhood became an intimate living room.\nAs the experiment drew to a close, Wilson took what he\u2019d learned and returned to the drawing board where Kasita came to life, a new category of home that married iconic design and pioneering technology with insights gleaned from a trashcan.\nThe Kasita is 208 square feet with 10-foot ceilings and is designed to not only feel spacious and full of light, but to be fully equipped with all the amenities you would find in a traditional home or apartment\u2014and then some. In addition to a walk-in shower, refrigerator, and convection oven the design team have also thrown in a dishwasher, washer/dryer combo, cooktop, and a queen size bed that easily tucks away out of sight (without having to even make it).\nYour Kasita will welcome you home by adjusting the A/C, bringing up the lights and shades, and queueing your favorite playlist. Or, ask your Kasita to do something else (like rolling out the bed) via hands-free voice commands throughout.\nKasita\u2019s unique tile system allows for virtually infinite customizations and options for the home while maintaining order and function.\nSave\nThe best part (in my humble opinion) is that the apartments are expected to rent at half of the market rate for a studio. The company expects to have Kasitas on the ground in Austin in 2016 and they are exploring rollout in ten additional cities (including one international city) starting in 2017.\nSpend your money on life \u2014 not rent. Through partnerships with local entities, Kasita will rent units at about half the market rate of a studio apartment. In Downtown Austin, that\u2019s about $600 a month.\nKasita is the smallest home built for the city. Its tiny size presents almost limitless opportunities for location.\nSend it my way!\nContact Us \nPrivacy Policy\nAbout Us \n\u00a9 Livinginashoebox.com",

When you hear this, your mind might automatically visualise a homeless man, or so I assume. But this is not the case, Jeff chose to live in a dumpster to escape his conventional, consumerist and comfortable lifestyle.\nAccording to the Washington Post, before his dumpster days, he was living in a comfortable, 3,000 square-foot home in Texas, with a walk-in closet, a grand and accessible bathroom and a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. He worked as a professor at a state university, he commuted one hour to work everyday and had \"a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\"\nAnd now, he has none of those things and has never been happier! So what changed?\nHe received a new job as an associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson Univsersity in Austin, and lived in a dumpster on the college campus for a year until he vacated last month.\n\u201cAS A WAY OF HAVING A BETTER LIFE, I DECIDED TO MOVE INTO A DUMPSTER.\u201d\n- JEFF WILSON TOLD THE POST\nHe decks out the dumpster pretty well, complete with air-conditioning, a mailbox and false-floor storage space. The challenge was done to prove that people don't need a big home packed with endless possessions to be happy, and they exist!\nThe immediate benefits were obvious to Wilson, they included lower rent, lower utility payments, less time spent doing chores, shorter commute (90 seconds on foot) and less money spent on unnecessary possessions.\nBecause of his much smaller living space, Wilson told the post that he spent a lot less time at home. Instead, he hung around on campus ACTUALLY speaking to people and interacting with other human beings.\nAccording to the Washington Post, \"There are all these studies that say the broader and deeper your social network is, not only does it create more happiness, but it increases your life span,\" Wilson said. \"In the modern home you can have a cradle to grave experience. Your doula can pop you out in the living room, you can get an MIT education online, order food from outside and then work from home until you die in the living room watching your flat screen TV.\"\nWilson had to give up almost all of his possessions. Among the few possessions he purchased while living in the dumpster were a garden gnome and a small air conditioning unit, as the dumpster reached scorching hot levels inside.\nFrom his dumpster experiment Wilson also learnt the detriment of noise, and how it keeps us from looking for a meaningful life.\n\"You can't be aware enough to watch for meaning if you're buried in e-mails or facing a barrage of direct messages on Twitter,\" he told The Post. \"You don't have the bandwidth or the time or the attention to watch. You're looking, but watching is a different exercise.\"\nThe dumpster project allows all of us to really think about the stuff we own and what we rely on, or what we THINK we need. If we take a leaf from Professor Dumpster's book then we can see just how little we need to be happy, and that human interaction and experiences are what create purpose... not things.\nImages credited to Sarah Natsumi More and Jeff Wilson\nDid you like this post?\nThen join us in taking practical climate action to live better for us and for the planet.\nJoin 1 Million Women\nCARBON\nCHALLENGE\n704,728,747,935\nTONNES OF CO2\nSAVINGS PLEDGED\nCan you cut 1 Tonne of carbon pollution out of your life?\nTake the challenge\nSUBSCRIBE TO\nOUR NEWSLETTER\nTo get a notification when new blog articles come out\nSubscribe\nSHEA HOGARTH\nFORMER INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT\nSUGGEST AN ARTICLE SEND US AN EMAIL\nPOPULAR BLOG ARTICLES\nWeaving a home...how one woman can help millions of people globally\n19th Aug 2015\n8 Single-Use Items to Ditch From Your Life\n18th Feb 2015\nThis alien-like creature will break your heart when you find out what it really is...\n18th Mar 2015\nCONTACT US\nPRIVACY POLICY\nTERMS OF USE\n\u00a9 COPYRIGHT 1 MILLION WOMEN\n  1",

        "content": "The Tiniest of Tiny Homes: An Austin Man is Living Inside a Dumpster\nBY MICHELLE BURWELL\nSyndicated from truthatlas.com, Nov 14, 2014\n  How much stuff do we really need to live happy, healthy lives? \u201cWhat this is, is an experiment to test to the absolute limit, if you can be happy and healthy in a very small space,\u201d said Jeff Wilson, Environmental Science professor and Dean of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. As people continue to scale down, living more simplistic, minimalist lives, many report feeling happier. To determine just how little a person could live happily and comfortable on, Wilson is conducting an experiment to see how small he can go; and he\u2019s doing it in a repurposed dumpster.\nFor one year Wilson will live in a 33 square ft dumpster, transforming the \u201chome\u201d from its bare bones to a high-tech., sustainable living quarter along the way, all while monitoring the minimum needed to survive and thrive. For the first few months of The Dumpster Project, Wilson was sleeping inside the dumpster on cardboard boxes. He has since upgraded to a bed, minimal storage and even air conditioning. He still fetches water but will soon be connecting a shower and toilet to the dumpster through the outside.\nWilson poses these thought-provoking questions to his class: What does home look like in a world of 10 billion people? How do we equip current and future generations with the tools they need for sustainable living practices? Can the world\u2019s finite resources actually sustain the swelling population?\nWilson will enter the project\u2019s third phase in a few months, the phase he calls the \u201cuber dumpster home.\u201d That\u2019s where the dumpster will be retrofitted with solar panels, go completely off the electric grid and obtain that coveted curb appeal\u2013 by making it look less like a dumpster.\nProfessor Wilson told The Atlantic, \u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I had before.\u201d\nOn October 6-8 The Dumpster Project will be on display at SXSWECO.\nPhotos: Sarah Natsumi\n    This article originally appeared in truthAtlas, an online news source featuring multi-media stories about people and ideas making the world a better place.

Photo / Jeff Wilson\nLower rent, lower power bills, less time spent doing chores and a shorter commute among myriad benefits.\nJeff Wilson's life had all the trappings of a conventional adult existence.\nFor starters, he was living in a comfortable, 280sqm Texas, home with a large walk-in wardrobe, an easily accessible bathroom and a US$1600 (NZ$2181) monthly mortgage payment. He had a professorship at a state university, an hour-long commute and a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\nDO YOU HAVE A STORY TO SHARE WITH LIFE & STYLE? SEND US AN EMAIL\nToday, Wilson has none of those things - and insists that he's never been happier.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertise with NZME.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertise with NZME.\nBetween then and now, there was a divorce, a new job in a new city, a surrendering of worldly possessions, a new social arrangement with a new romantic partner and - perhaps most importantly - an olive green rubbish skip that he called home.\nUntil he vacated it last month to move in with his new girlfriend, Wilson - an associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin - spent an entire year living in a converted trash receptacle on the historically black college campus.\nOn its face, turning the 3sqm space into a livable home - complete with an air conditioner unit, weather station, mailbox, and a false-floor basement to store cooking equipment and clothes - was a bold exercise in sustainability that demonstrated a person's ability to comfortably exist in a space 1 per cent the size of the average American household.\n\"It's an insane idea on the surface, and it may be an insane idea below the surface,\" he told the Washington Post.\nWilson said the immediate benefits of living in the container were myriad: Lower rent, lower utility payments, less time spent doing chores, a shorter commute (approximately 90 seconds on foot) and less money spent on unnecessary possessions. Those benefits may sound underwhelming compared to the sacrifice involved, but in totality, Wilson said, they offered a new freedom.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAdvertise with NZME.\nBecause his living space was so small, Wilson said he also spent much less time at home.\nInstead, he was frequently on and around campus, having face-to-face interactions. (Importantly, he also had to leave the skip to use the toilet or take showers, which he did at the campus gymnasium.)\nWilson made the dumpster feel like home. Photo / Jeff Wilson\nHe was forced to give away almost everything he owned, he said. At his most spartan, he owned four pants, four shirts (two short-sleeve and two long-sleeve), three pairs of shoes, three hats and eight or nine bowties, according to the SpareFoot Blog.\nAmong the few possessions he did purchase were a garden gnome and a small AC unit to offset the blazing summer heat, which reached as high as 54C.\nDiscover more\nNEW ZEALAND\nThe truth about house prices\n18 Jul 04:02 AM\nLIFESTYLE\nThe invisible man\n25 Oct 05:00 AM\nENTERTAINMENT\nBlock duo's secret paradise\n26 Oct 12:00 AM\nLIFESTYLE\n10 ways to cut your food bill\n10 Nov 04:45 AM\nBut as \"Professor Dumpster\" (as he is now known) readjusts to a more demanding lifestyle, he has come to realise that the last year was also an experiment in reducing \"noise.\"\nNot necessarily the audible kind, he said, but the kind of noise that arrives in the form of endless e-mails and informational overload that has spawned the \"digital detox\" movement.\nFor now, the skip will remain on campus as an educational tool for students, artists and educators, who can tour the home or spend a few nights inside.\nJoin the conversation of the Herald Life Facebook page\nLatest from Lifestyle\nPREMIUM\nLIFESTYLE\nAdvice: Kids are yelling at my son during break times.

Reduce, reuse, recycle. I use metal water bottles over and over again; I reuse my kitchen trash in the compost bin in my garden; and I make my own paper with scrap paper from the mailbox and other waste that would generally go into the landfill.\nThe story I\u2019m about to tell you, frankly, is something I would not try, but this is one man\u2019s experiment into the darkest depths of cutting back.\nBelow is a photo of a dumpster. We\u2019ve all seen them. But, can you imagine living in one? (Not only no, but h\u2014 no, was my initial response). Read on.\nA college professor named Jeff Wilson lived in a dumpster for a year. It was located on the campus of the Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, where he teaches.\nWilson, an environmental studies professor, wanted to prove one could live happily and in health in a very small space. After all, millions of people around the world live in a lot less space than we are used to. So he set about finding a new home in a dumpster. The dumpster he chose had 33 square feet of living space. The average American home has about 2,500 square feet.\nHaving lots of collections from the many countries I have visited, and a collection of Venetian and Czech glass, I find it difficult to imagine living in 33 square feet. But Wilson managed to do it in comfort for a year. He had an air conditioner, a shower, toilet, kitchen, wi-fi and even solar power.\nThe professor said he wanted to be the ultimate \u201cone-percenter.\u201d His goal was to create only 1 percent of the waste that is created in the average home, and use 1 percent of the energy and water we all do.\n\u201cProfessor Dumpster,\u201d as he was lovingly called, spent his days teaching environmental science, and in the dumpster, he was testing sustainable technologies and low-waste living.\nStudents had a lot to say about him living in a trash bin, including the possibility of homeless people finding shelter in a trash-can village. They began to think in terms of a minimalist. They donated time and skills to the project, and cut out things like cars, which cause pollution, and in some students\u2019 minds were completely unnecessary. Everything they needed was within walking distance of the university. The Dumpster Project began giving tours of dumpster homes to encourage more people to take the plunge into dumpster living.\nThe question for the future is: How can we equip upcoming generations with the tools they need to have a sustainable lifestyle? One answer is with a 33-square-foot dumpster and a team of dumpster experts to transform a trash container into a sustainable house.\nI wonder how many people could actually do this, unless it were necessary?\nDr. Karen Magid, known as Doctor Basura (\u201ctrash\u201d in Spanish), is the project manager for the dumpster project at the university. Dr. Amanda Masino, aka The Dirt-y Professor, is the head of the Green is the New Black student group and an assistant professor of biology. She also works on the dumpster project. She is working on a dumpster science lab.\nDr. Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, lived in the dumpster for a year, proving it is possible to be happy and healthy in less space.\nOK, readers \u2026 who\u2019s going to try this next? If this isn\u2019t for you, you might like to nominate your favorite teacher. The Dumpster Project is currently taking nominations.\n    Dianne Erskine-Hellrigel is executive director of the Community Hiking Club and president of the Santa Clara River Watershed Conservancy.

When we had a guinea pig, I used the shreds from our paper shredder to line the bottom of the cage. (Green and saves $$) The round cardboard circle behind the frozen pizzas can be wrapped in foil and reused as a cake platter. The cardboard mushroom boxes can be reused in SO many ways! Misprints from your printer can be reused as note paper. I usually cut stacks in half and staple them. Plastic produce bags have many uses including doggy poop bags. I wash out plastic butter tubs/Cool Whip containers and reuse. The tops of these containers can be used for arts and crafts: holding glue or glitter, etc. Many of the `to go\u2019 containers from fast food restaurants can be washed and reused. I wash out the plastic Starbucks cups and reuse many times. I have saved large oatmeal containers and coffee cans and donated them to my local kindergarten class to use for art projects. :)\nReply\nT. Jones says:\nMonday, Mar 2, 2015 at\nI do all the things Michele Klein Feldman does and more. Reduce and reuse is the key. Very little of what we \u201crecycle\u201d is actually recycled. Most still end up in landfills\u2013sorry to tell the truth or better yet, get you searching for it. However, I\u2019ve never understood these demonstrations of silliness by\u2026living in a dumpster, kids sleeping in a cardboard box, celebrities eating beans and rice et, al. We need real solutions. Not feel-goodism. Living in a dumpster was like camping or a tree house for this guy. He\u2019s young, idealistic and now seemingly celebrated by those who think this is a viable idea. It\u2019s not. Micro house movement-yes, living in a dumpster-no.\nReply\nT. Jones says:\nMonday, Mar 2, 2015 at\nFurthermore, I think the idea of sympathizing with the homeless by living in a dumpster is insulting. Really\u2026I have to live in a dumpster to \u201cunderstand\u201d how much it sucks? Whats\u2019s next do I have to have cancer to understand how much that sucks too. Sorry, I don\u2019t think so!\nReply\nTessa Lucero says:\nTuesday, Mar 3, 2015 at\nI\u2019m all for reduce, reuse, recycle, especially reducing consumption since reusing requires space to keep things you intend to reuse and recycling consumes resources even if the items do get recycled. However, living in a dumpster seems a bit extreme. How much did it cost in time, money, and materials to outfit that dumpster to become living space? How energy-efficient is an uninsulated dumpster? And what happens when the first Texas-sized tornado comes along?\nReply\nLeave a Comment\nName (required):\nEmail (required):\nWebsite:\n\nOPINION SECTION POLICY\nAll opinions and ideas are welcome.

So seriously that he\u2019s planning on ditching the dive and actually living in a dumpster for an entire year. This won\u2019t be your typical trash-muck-encrusted dumpster, though; \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d and his students will be designing their own 33-square-foot dumpster outfitted with a bed, shower, toilet, and even WiFi. Wilson\u2019s living space will double as a classroom \u2014 his students will then work on making the teensy residence as energy efficient and low-impact as possible. \u201cI\u2019m essentially becoming part of the 1%. This dumpster is 33 square feet, which is 1% the size of the new American home in 2011,\u201d Wilson joked. \u201cThe idea here is to ultimately show one can have a pretty good life in a dumpster.\u201d\nThis college professor is so sneaky it hurts. He\u2019s pretending he\u2019s making a grand statement about the environment by moving into a dumpster but he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing: Making his students build a bachelor pad for him under the disguise of \u201ccollege\u201d. Sounds like a dream come true for me. Everything I need in a 33 square foot apartment. I don\u2019t need a dining room table or a place for people to put their shoes. I need the internet, a microwave, a tv, and a chair to watch the tv. Professor Sneaky over here is even throwing in a shower out of pure arrogance. Calling it a dumpster when it\u2019s clearly not even close to a dumpster in order to pretend he cares about saving the whales. In reality he just wants a place to stroke his dick and not pay any bills.\nREAD MORE\n\nNate\n10/18/2013 2:44 AM\n0\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

The pre-fabricated homes can be constructed in three weeks \u2014 and could go a long way toward easing the affordable housing crunch that has bedeviled much of the country.\n\nWith the help of former employees at Google, Elon Musk's SolarCity and Bell Helicopter, Wilson thinks he has a solution to provide homes and stackable apartments in unused pieces of land such as vacant parking lots. \"If you file for a backyard unit, it can be approved in weeks,\" says Wilson, who predicts his homes could hit the market this summer.\n\"We need to find cracks in the system rather than take a sledgehammer to it,\" he says.\nIf the reaction of consumers at Kasita's recent party at SXSW is any indication, interest is high. Hundreds patiently waited in line to get a peek at the modular home, which features a bathroom/shower, kitchen, bedroom and living room patio.\nA remote control allows dwellers to quickly change mood lighting and an entertainment system. Date mode finds Marvin Gaye's smooth voice filling the small living area. Storage space is built into steps, walls and other nooks and crannies.\nThe 21-person start-up, based here, is not only espousing the mantra that small is beautiful, but it can be environmental and profitable.

After all, dating a guy who lives in a refurbished dumpster isn't for everyone.\nSure enough, his new paramour was cool with it, and Wilson, a professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Texas, says it was at that moment that he realized they were \"meant to be.\"\n\"She has stayed in there a few nights with me,\" he said, referring to his dumpster, during a HuffPost Live interview Thursday.\nWilson said that his \"alternative housing situation\" actually helps their dating life because it forces them to engage in stimulating activities outside.\n\"I feel like we actually spend more time together now,\" he explained. \"Obviously we don't spend much time at my place, but we actually don't spend that much time at her place, either. We find ourselves roaming around the city more, interacting with others on campus more, others in various parts of town. We made a local hotel our living room, in some sense.

Photo By: SARAH NATSUMI\nIn the spring of 2017, Jeff Wilson felt good. Kasita, the modular housing start-up he had founded two years earlier, was thriving. For a second year in a row, he had displayed a prototype of his prefabricated apartment module at SXSW. The year before, it had won the conference innovation award for smart cities. This time around, he presented the module with a tantalizingly sleek and modern upgrade. The media loved it. They concluded, almost unanimously, that he was the Real Deal. And that was before the company had sold a single unit. If Wilson had any doubts, he didn\u2019t show them.\n\u201cKasita is on the verge of disrupting the urban housing market in ways not seen in real estate and development in 150 years,\u201d he told Forbes in 2016. Wilson did not respond to requests for an interview with Texas Architect.\nKasita, a cute if unoriginal play on the Spanish word for \u201clittle house,\u201d sought to \u201cdisrupt the housing market\u201d using modular design and construction to produce micro-dwellings that could be built in a fraction of the time and sold at a fraction of the price of traditional urban housing. They were affordable, sustainable, and efficient, and if all went according to plan, they were going to solve the architectural and planning problems of urban growth, one Kasita at a time. It was ambitious, and maybe even visionary.\nWhen Wilson unveiled his first prototype in 2016, it drew attention from a host of media outlets, including Dezeen and The New York Times. Texas architect Dason Whitsett, AIA, then refined the basic model to create the 2017 prototype: a 352-sf, aluminum-clad rectangular prism with a glazed cube cantilevered at one end. It featured smart home technology with which users could command lighting, temperature, and sound systems. A rendering depicted the modular units stacked on top of one another within a metal framework to create a mid-rise condominium that would appeal to developers. But the most important development was that, this time around, it was going on the market. Kasita was finally taking orders. \nKasita founder Jeff Wilson was regarded by many within the company as a visionary thinker, but a less than competent manager of the company.\nPhoto By: ELIZABETH HACKLER\nThe design and production announcement inspired more media coverage and more investment capital. By the following fall, Kasita had raised at least $11.5 million, obtained permitting to sell in Nevada and California, and moved to a 25,000-sf manufacturing site in East Austin. It had garnered design accolades from the Texas Society of Architects for its integrated interior design that efficiently and gracefully maximized limited space.\nKasita, along with its founder, had become the darling of the Austin start-up world. The company married ground-breaking ideas with smart design and advanced technology all wrapped in an impressively marketable, very millennial minimalism. It seemed destined to succeed. In not more than a year, its manufacturing building would be closed and calls to its office would ring indefinitely.\nThe closure happened very quickly and very quietly. Surprisingly few people noticed. Some would-be customers on Instagram made inquiries, but otherwise the internet had gone silent on Kasita. Its website and social media accounts were up, but no one was posting. Kasita was like a ghost town, not gone but eerily silent.\nLearning what happened to Kasita is interesting for the same reason getting to know someone is interesting: The discovery of remarkable discrepancies between appearance and reality. But Kasita\u2019s story reveals more than just one company\u2019s behind-the-scenes drama on the course of its downfall. Kasita was ostensibly positioning itself to solve one of humankind\u2019s most pressing problems: how to sustainably manage urban growth in terms of housing and urban planning. It was using one of the most promising models architects have identified as a solution: modular design and construction. Considering this, the real question is not what happened to Kasita, but to what extent does Kasita\u2019s failure reflect the future not only of modular design and construction, but also of the very world in which humans will soon live?\nTrue modular design is a relatively recent phenomenon. Traditional methods of prefabrication had been applied only on a smaller scale until architects in the 1960s experimented with full-fledged modularity, which implied the prefabrication of a more finished unit of construction, such as an apartment module.\nPost-World War II urban growth led architects around the world to consider how best to collectively design for a rapidly changing urban landscape. Architects in Japan such as Kenzo Tange began pioneering Metabolism, an architectural theory that viewed modularity as means of designing an urban environment adaptable to growth, notably in the wake of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the words of Kisho Kurokawa, Metabolism posited architecture not as \u201csomething that is completed and fixed, but rather something that grows towards the future, expanded upon, renovated, and developed.\u201d By the early 1960s, Peter Cook of Archigram in London and Arata Isozaki in Tokyo were creating plans for utopian self-sufficient cities that coordinated technology and containerized units into an adaptable circulatory system of infrastructure.\nHowever, the first successful project to physically realize these visions of modular design was Habitat 67, unveiled by Moshe Safdie at Expo 67 in Montreal. Safdie designed Habitat 67 as an apartment building composed of 354 identical prefabricated modules stacked to form a vertical agglomeration of linked concrete boxes that served as both individual living units and the infrastructure that connected these units. In 1968, Cerna & Garza Architects used a more industrial method of modular design to create the Hilton hotel on the River Walk in San Antonio by uniformly installing 500 prefabricated modules in a mere 28 weeks. Finally, in 1972, Kisho Kurokawa built the precedent-setting Nakagin Capsule Tower with 140 prefabricated cell-capsule units individually bolted onto a single concrete shaft. The philosophy and methodology behind the tower would inspire 21st-century designs like Kasita\u2019s, notably in the way Kasita aimed to stack its modules into a dense residential development to relieve increasingly clogged urban residential markets. \nDespite the Japanese developments, modular design as a means of addressing urban growth through collective housing ended in the early 1970s, when public policy and neoliberal economic theory encouraged private spending on single-family homes in the midst of a housing boom and global energy crisis. In 1973, President Nixon imposed a moratorium on all new public housing construction commitments, after which the focus of federal housing assistance shifted away from constructing new public housing units to using the existing private housing market. The privatization of the housing market would continue through the 70s and 80s as Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan promoted deregulation and liberal economic theory.\nNow, well into the 21st century, architects are once again looking to modular design to respond to the rapid growth, expansion, and sprawl of modern cities despite the neoliberal framework in which the American economy still operates. By manufacturing large modules that are arranged on-site, architects can increase both quantity and quality while reducing labor costs and project duration. When combined with micro-unit living concepts, modular urban structures can increase density and provide adaptability to market fluctuations \u2014 if housing demand in one area dropped, for example, a modular unit could easily be moved to the next hotspot. It is the marriage of architecture and manufacturing.\n\u201cIt just transfers the skill and knowledge into the factory,\u201d architect and urbanist Sinclair Black, FAIA, says. \u201cIt builds more units, faster, with less cost in theory,\u201d but, \u201cwhat we don\u2019t have is the means of production.\u201d\nThat was precisely Kasita\u2019s problem.\nWilson doesn\u2019t have an architecture, design, or construction background. He co-founded Kasita with Taylor Wilson (unrelated) in the fall of 2015 after teaching environmental sciences at Huston-Tillotson University. He spent a year living in a metal dumpster on campus as an experiment in minimal living and human footprint reduction and came to be known as \u201cProfessor Dumpster.\u201d It was Wilson\u2019s first claim to fame, his first media fanfare, and the starting point of his idea for Kasita.\nPhotos By: SARAH NATSUMI MOORE\nAs Wilson expanded his vision from mobile, minimal living to include modular production methodology, two investors, in addition to co-founder Taylor Wilson, got the start-up off the ground. One was the COO, Brian Tochman, who soon after left to start his own venture capital firm. The other was Gary Keller, founder of the world\u2019s largest real estate firm, Keller Williams. With that funding, Wilson hired California-based industrial designer Remy Labesque to create the original design concept for Kasita and later enlisted Whitsett to develop that prototype into a livable reality. \nBy spring of 2017, Wilson had done what he does best: get the word out. The release of Kasita\u2019s 2017 design at SXSW came with an exquisite marketing package. After nearly two years of planning and venture capital courtship, Kasita seemed ready to move into its execution phase. The board of directors, however, decided the company needed a new chief executive for that stage. One Kasita executive said that \u201cthe original founder had a great story but was not a great manager of the company.\u201d Wilson consequently became the president of the board and remained as a consultant.\nDuring that time, Tochman left Kasita and Benji Miller took over his role as COO. Casey Wu stayed on as CFO, and, in August, the board hired Martyn Hoffmann as the new CEO. This team of executives had a diverse but thorough range of experience. Hoffman brought private equity firm Greenfield Partners on as a Series A investor, which became the major source of funding from that point on. The new leadership recognized that Kasita \u2014 like any modular housing company \u2014 would only be efficient enough to draw a profit when operating at a large scale. They needed to market to developers, not individual buyers wanting a backyard ADU.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re at scale, you can do smaller projects, but when you\u2019re not at scale, you can\u2019t. There\u2019s no cost advantage,\u201d said an executive who asked to remain anonymous.\nHowever, they quickly discovered the challenges inherent to modular design and construction.\nBy November of 2017, Kasita had gone through the extremely tedious job of getting permitted to sell their modular dwellings in Nevada and California. However, that task was taking longer in Colorado and New York, where they actually had two deals with condominium developers on the table. Navigating archaic laws and plodding along to the sluggish step of bureaucracy ate up time and money, stymying the interest of developers. But there was another issue with Kasita\u2019s attempts at expansions outside of Texas: transportation costs.\n\u201cThe problem of transportation logistics in modular building construction is the problem of modular building construction,\u201d wrote architect David Wallance, AIA, author of \u201cMoving Parts: Architecture in a Flat World.\u201d\nThe cost of transporting a Kasita to its site ate directly into the economic efficiency gained on the labor side of modular construction. They couldn\u2019t efficiently transport their product beyond a 150-200-mile radius. Added to that was the problem of how to transport a large number of Kasitas within the same timeframe to meet a developer\u2019s large demand.\nFrom November through the spring of 2018, Kasita executives continued strategically negotiating deals with developers in Denver and in New York City, despite the aforementioned problems. However, the ultimate, intrinsic problem that prevented a deal from solidifying was scaling.\n\u201cIt always came back to our ability to scale and our ability to be funded,\u201d a supply chain project manager at Kasita said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an ability to scale that large without any funding.\u201d\nKasita had raised millions by the spring of 2018, but by that time, Greenfield Partners had lost interest in the company due to its inability to close a deal. They started scaling back their funding, making the task of closing a deal that much more difficult.\nSince modular design and construction is essentially manufacturing, time and cost efficiency increase on a large scale, as is the case with any mass-produced good. Since Kasita\u2019s manufacturing facilities couldn\u2019t produce more than approximately 50 Kasitas in a year, they needed at least $20 million more to begin producing at the scale developers required.\nAs in the 1970s, this is an instance of neoliberal economic theory grinding urban design innovation to a halt. Kasita, like the modular design and construction industry at large, required risk and cost absorption on the part of the investor. Any business attempting to \u201cdisrupt\u201d an entire industry \u2014 such as the construction and housing industries \u2014 is going to meet a significant headwind. As long as these start-ups are governed by the whims of circumspect investors, it will remain difficult to spark significant change.\n\u201cAnyone that hasn\u2019t raised $50-100 million is in the same boat,\u201d an executive said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how anyone else is going to overcome the exact same issue.\u201d\nHowever, Kasita had its own internal problems that exacerbated challenges in managing these industry-wide issues. There was the ever-changing leadership, to start. Martyn Hoffman, the newest CEO, left the company within six months for personal reasons. That left the CFO and COO running the company for three months while trying to negotiate a deal for its sale as their investors balked.\nBut before that deal was finalized, they were shocked to discover that someone else had bought out their investor: Jeff Wilson. According to employees, Wilson fired the COO and CFO on his first day back. He also fired the heads of marketing and sales, who had been hired under that leadership. In an announcement, he told the remaining employees it was necessary to cut those payrolls to keep the company afloat, but some saw his move as vindictive.\nKasita\u2019s minimal interior feels larger than its 352-sf label would lead one to believe thanks to efficient spatial design and an abundance of natural light. The micro-dwelling also features smart home technology where one can remotely control lighting, temperature, and sound systems.\nPhotos By: SARAH NATSUMI MOORE\nOne employee described the environment afterwards as frightening in terms of job security. Another said everybody was excited when Wilson came back. Whatever the prevailing opinion, it was clear that Kasita had suffered from a chronic lack of direction with a high executive turnover rate.\nThe company also could have been smarter with its spending before it reached the execution phase in 2017. Instead of pumping money into executive salaries, massive marketing campaigns, and technology development for its smart home capabilities, it could have invested in assets for manufacturing.\nThere was also argument over the economy of the design. The cantilevered support system for the glass cube added significant cost to manufacturing the module. Some executives wanted to make it optional, but others considered it an iconic part of the design. This provoked the enduring question of the balance between trying to maintain an architectural vision and the reality of what a customer is willing to pay.\nAfter returning as executive, Wilson wasn\u2019t able to make any deals with developers. In late fall of 2018, Wilson announced the closure and sale of Kasita. A company quickly bought its assets and that was that.\nWhere this leaves modular design remains unclear. Kasita was a company with big ideas and inventive design but an inability to execute. Even excluding its missteps, it\u2019s uncertain if Kasita would have been able to succeed, considering the construction industry\u2019s reluctance to innovate and investors\u2019 distaste for risky propositions that are costly in the short run. What it does show is that modular design and other solutions to urban growth need more than one ambitious company to succeed; they need industry-wide collaboration and willingness to change.\nChristiana Sullivan is a freelance journalist based in Austin.\nTAGS: Featuredkasita\nShare this Article\nView all posts by Christiana\n4 Comments\nMatthew Sutton on 7th September 2020, 6:38 pm\nI was interested in Kasita and even went to an open house road show they had in San Jose. I\u2019m very sorry to hear they are gone. I can agree with the basic point that transportation and logistics costs would have to be more reasonable to make the entire prefab concept worthwhile, and that\u2019s not a problem exclusive to just Kasita. Ideally a prefab operation would have regional manufacturing centers that could scale as needed\u2026.but this requires vast capitalization. But obviously an interested home buyer in say Alaska, or Key West, or Hawaii is going to be sticker shocked by the cost to transport and install one of these $90k modules and have to conclude they aren\u2019t worthwhile. Even the cost of getting one from Texas to Oregon was quite high, regardless of their ability to help with permitting. I can see how developers would be especially wary when questions of scale start to arise.\nReply\nKathy Everett on 27th October 2020, 11:36 pm\nI would like to know if there are any Kasita homes for sale (back stock, or private owners) at this time.\nOctober 27, 2020\nKathy Everett\nKeeToHealth@gmail.com\nReply\nBarbara Joubert on 13th November 2020, 8:49 pm\nI\u2019m on the same page as Kathy\u2026are there any left for sale? Can I buy the leftovers?\nThanksBJ\nReply\nJames Donne on 28th December 2020, 9:45 pm\nSince one of the problems of modular construction units is proximity of the factory to the installation site to reduce transportation cost perhaps the modularity concept could be applied to the factory. A factory that could be disassembled and moved near a site where a large number of units would be sold, thus minimizing transportation cost of the completed individual units. The construction equipment could be placed in a rented warehouse or similar structure. Of course it would only be a viable option if a large number of units were needed in one area.\nReply\nLeave a Comment\nName\nEmail\nWebsite\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nComment\nAbout\nAbout Texas Architect\nAdvertise\nBoard of Directors\nEditorial Calendar\nSubmitting Materials\nContact Us\nSocial\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nFacebook\nInstagram\nSubscribe Today\nTexas Architect Magazine\n500 Chicon Street\nAustin, TX 78702 USA\nGet Directions\n\u00a9 2003 - 2024 Texas Architect Magazine Terms & Conditions| Privacy",

He's moved out from the dumpster, yes, the dumpster, he called home for one full year on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas.\n\nHe's an Environmental Studies professor who he says he wanted to prove you can be happy and healthy in a very small space the way millions of people live around the world. Very small is an understatement try 33 square feet compared with the almost 2,500 square feet of the average American home.\n\nIn reality, it was sometimes less than ideal. He did have some amenities though, like a mailbox, air conditioner, and eventually solar power.\n\nWilson says he wants to be the ultimate one-percenter: Create only one percent of the waste of the average home, and use one percent of the energy and water.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nMore on AOL:\nWhy you should always be kind to strangers on public transit\nThe most wonderfully awkward moments on the Oscars red carpet\n89-year-old grandpa surprises Tinder dates, and their reactions are amazing\nShow comments\nIn Other News\nEntertainment\nUSA TODAY\n'Real Housewives' alum Vicki Gunvalson says she survived 'deadly' health scare, misdi\u2026\nPeople\nJessica Simpson sizzles in second-skin catsuit, big hair and even bigger hoops: See h\u2026\nFinance\nReuters\nAsian stocks slip as geopolitical fears sap confidence\nFortune\nRed Lobster\u2019s new leader is a millennial Wall Street fave who doesn\u2019t believe in work\u2026\nFood\nCheapism\n25 dishes and drinks named after famous people\nGood Morning America\nUS Open recipes to serve signature cocktails, chef-inspired dishes at home\nLighter Side\nThe Today Show\nParents share why they are serving dinner as early as 3:45 pm: It's 'life changing'\nFox News\nTwo West Virginia fishing buddies break state records within hours of each other\nSports\nUSA TODAY\nUS Open Day 1: What you missed as 2024's final Grand Slam begins\nUSA TODAY\nNFL roster cuts 2024: Live updates on notable moves ahead of Tuesday's deadline\nWeather\nUSA TODAY\nHurricane Gilma tracker: See projected path of second Pacific storm approaching Hawai\u2026\nAccuWeather\nNortheast faces mix of hot air and powerful storms\nFeedback\nHelp\nJoin AOL\nAccessibility\nEU Digital Services Act\nTerms and Privacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard\nAbout Us\nAbout Our Ads\nAdvertising\nSitemap\n\u00a9 2024 Yahoo.

Wilson\u2019s not \u201call talk\u201d, either, and will spend the next year of his life living in a standard 6\u2019x6\u2032 commercial dumpster to prove his point.\nThis dumpster, to be specific \u2026\nMy Latest Videos\nLawns, as we know them, have held their landscaping tyranny over our yards for far too long.

That\u2019s a dumpster.\nCalling him \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d, the Dumpster Project website is chronicling Wilson\u2019s year in the dumps- which began back in February- and using his experience as a basis for a video documentary that will, presumably, debut at SXSW next year. Accoring to the site, Wilson \u201cwill be spending one year in a dumpster that is approximately 6 feet x 6 feet, or about 1% the size of the average new American home. Professor Dumpster, in his bid to become part of the \u2018new 1%\u2019 will strive to use 1% the water, 1% the energy, and create 1% the waste of the average American home.\u201d\nFor the moment, the dumpster is just that- a 6\u00d76 foot dumpster that\u2019s been cleaned out, painted, and hooked up to the grid. Wilson, however, has bigger plans for his 1% home. If \u201cphase 1\u201d is the dumpster, itself, \u201cphase 2\u201d adds a shade structure to minimize his need for the \u201cwindow\u201d mounted AC unit, as well as a laundry unit/bathroom built into a tool shed next to the unit \u2026\n\u2026 now, if you\u2019re anything like me, you noticed that Wilson seems to be saying that he wants to take up quite a bit more than the \u201c1% of a new home\u201d he originally talked about, but he\u2019s still committed to using a small % of a new home\u2019s footprint while staying at that 1% level of resources. He plans to do that by building up, rather than out \u2026\n\u2026 Wilson\u2019s forward-looking plans would stack dumpsters, Lego-style, and use their opened \u201clids\u201d as perfectly placed solar \u201cleaves\u201d, each of which would hold a solar PV panel of its own that would allow Professor Dumpster to separate fully from the grid, and even teach his classes outside.\nYou can check out Wilson\u2019s \u201cpitch\u201d for the project in a short video, below, and let us know what you think of Wilson\u2019s extreme tiny house experiment- and whether or not you think you could be happy in a 6\u00d76\u2032 footprint!- in the comments section at the bottom of the page.

And there\u2019s not much thought given to the processes behind that,\u201d he told KVUE.\nWilson, a professor at Huston-Tillotson in Austin, Tex., is taking part in the Dumpster Project, packing only items he can fit into a backpack and selling the rest of his possessions.\nWilson, who teaches environmental science at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, will move in on Thanksgiving Day.\nWith just a sports bag of possessions and a sleeping bag strung up on a hammock, he\u2019ll then spend the following 12 months gradually kitting the shelter out with creature comforts.\nHelped by his students, he plans to completely renovate his new home and install solar panels.\nWilson begins living in the dumpster on Thanksgiving Day and will live in it for one year.\nAfter the yearlong Dumpster Project is finished, Wilson would like to turn his temporary home into an off-campus bachelor pad.\nOn a mobile device?

It was, he says, \"a radical experiment in what it would mean to live on, and in, less\" - specifically, 33 square feet. He moved out in February, but the experiment continues.\nNine educators since have taken up residency for up to a week to see what it's like to live without running water. Cooking is on a camping stove. But there is electricity. To battle interior heat that rises to over 130 degrees in Texas' sweltering summers, the bin had to be connecting to the grid so air conditioning could be installed. There's now a TV and an overhead light. But it's still tight quarters.\nADVERTISEMENT\nArticle continues below this ad\n\"There were a few who grabbed the spirit early on, like they were camping,\" says Amanda M. Masino, a biology professor and co-director of the Dumpster Project. \"And then there were some that brought two pieces of luggage and realized they didn't have room to open it in here.\"\nTeachers are welcome for sleepovers. And Masino has developed a curriculum in which students design workable tech for the space - such as using sheep wool, more environmentally friendly than fiberglass, as insulation. Elementary students might build water filters; college students design solar-powered installations. More than 1,400 have visited the container, which also travels to science and art exhibits across the state to share its sustainability message.\nAs for Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, he had his dislikes (school gym as bathroom) and likes (mobility, scaled-down possessions). He has left Huston-Tillotson to funnel the lessons learned into an urban living experiment: prefab apartments of only 225 square feet (seven times the size of his previous residence) that fit onto a rack and can be transported. Each rack holds four units. Austin gets the first rack in April (rent: about $600 a month before slotting fees), with other cities to follow.\n\"Even at the extreme end of the spectrum,\" Wilson concludes, \"a lot less can bring a lot more to your life.\"\nFeb 6, 2016\nNicholas St. Fleur\nMost Popular\n1.\nGeto Boys member and Houston rapper Scarface is in the ICU\n2.\nClasses canceled after Rice student killed in murder-suicide\n3.\nScarface: A short history of an ailing Houston music legend\n4.\nChris Stapleton and Miranda Lambert bring star power to Houston\n5.\nSheryl Swoopes calls Stephen A.

Each home is 352 square feet, stackable and costs $139,000. They\u2019re well suited for people who love to travel and like to spend time outside and out and about instead of cooped up in their homes.\nOriginally, Kasita was exploring the ability to allow each little home to move from city to city by hauling them on a truck and plugging them into a unit of Kasitas. Potential customers were more interested in elevating the technology within the homes and then simply moving their small amount of belongings from home to home if they so choose, Curbed explains.\nThere\u2019s so much to see and learn about these incredible little Kasitas.

Wilson\u2014who earned his doctorate at Harvard\u2014has taken the extreme measure to demonstrate the need for people to adopt more sustainable lifestyles or run the risk of using up the Earth\u2019s resources.\nIn its letter, PETA points out that prestigious institutions\u2014including the United Nations and the Stockholm International Water Institute\u2014have determined that a shift to a plant-based diet is vital for everything from slowing climate change to feeding the world\u2019s growing population. As an example, cattle consume 17 times more calories in grain than they produce as meat.\n\u201cWith so many delicious and Earth-friendly meat-, dairy-, and egg-free foods available, no one has to live in a dumpster to help save the planet,\u201d says PETA Special Projects Manager Alicia Woempner. \u201cAnd because meat-eaters are more prone to life-threatening conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, Dr. Wilson can help ensure his own sustainability simply by going vegan.\u201d\nFor more information, please visit PETA.org.\n  PETA\u2019s letter to Dr. Jeff Wilson follows.\n  February 10, 2014\n  Dr. Jeff Wilson\nExecutive Director\nThe Dumpster Project\n  Dear Dr. Wilson:\nI\u2019m writing on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and our more than 3 million members and supporters, including thousands across Texas. As an organization that works hard to raise awareness of the devastating impact of the animal-agriculture industry on our environment, we applaud your efforts to promote sustainable living. I\u2019d also like to urge you to go vegan and encourage your students to do the same, since cutting out resource-intensive meat, egg, and dairy foods is the best thing that we can all do to protect the planet and animals.\nRaising and killing animals for food is simply unsustainable. The United Nations has stated that a global shift to a vegan diet is vital in order to combat the worst effects of climate change, and the Stockholm International Water Institute warns that transitioning to a plant-based diet is the only way to feed the world\u2019s growing population. Eating meat wastes valuable resources. It takes up to 13 pounds of grain and 2,500 gallons of water to produce just a pound of meat. And it takes 18 times more land to produce 1 pound of chicken than it does to produce 1 pound of high-protein, cholesterol-free vegan \u201cchicken.\u201d\nIn addition to trashing the planet, the meat, dairy, and egg industries cause untold amounts of animal suffering. Chickens, for example, are crammed into filthy, ammonia-filled sheds for the majority of their short lives before they are packed into trucks for transport through all weather extremes to slaughter, during which they have their throats cut while they\u2019re still conscious and are often scalded to death in defeathering tanks.\nAll of us can help the environment without giving up our comfortable homes or favorite foods, simply by going vegan. Major grocery stores are stocked with delicious vegan foods\u2014from meat-free sausages to plant-based milks made from almonds, rice, or soy\u2014that can be stored safely, without any need for energy-intensive refrigeration.\nThank you for your consideration.\nSincerely,\nMarta Holmberg\nDirector of Youth Outreach\nFor Media: Contact PETA's Media Response Team.\nCONTACT\nGET PETA UPDATES\nFOLLOW US\nGET PETA UPDATES\nStay up to date on the latest vegan trends and get breaking animal rights news delivered straight to your inbox!\n\u201cAlmost all of us grew up eating meat, wearing leather, and going to circuses and zoos. We never considered the impact of these actions on the animals involved. For whatever reason, you are now asking the question: Why should animals have rights?\u201d\n\u2014 Ingrid E.

And then wrote this unnerving \u201cIt Happened To Me\u201d story for XOJane which included the detail that the dumpster was behind the women\u2019s dormitory at the university where he taught? (Seriously, were there no dumpsters behind the business school? Or the environmental studies program?)\nWell, Dumpster Dad is back, and he\u2019s now been promoted to Professor Dumpster. The Atlantic has a lengthy feature on Professor Dumpster (aka Jeff Wilson), one of those sweet glossy features with animated GIFs and dumpster schematics, and here are a few of the updates on Professor Dumpster\u2019s life:\n\u2014 People actually call Wilson \u201cProfessor Dumpster.\u201d I have no idea if this generated naturally or if it is Wilson\u2019s self-styled nickname (and BRAND). I do know that it is the name on Wilson\u2019s Instagram.\n\u2014 When we last heard from Wilson, he was ABD \u2014 All But Dumpster. Yes, when he first announced himself on the dumpster-living scene he wasn\u2019t actually living full-time in the dumpster! He was just camping there sometimes. Now he\u2019s apparently in the dumpster nearly every night, except for the nights he trades off with students from Green Is the New Black, an ecology group.\n\u2014 The dumpster is \u201csanctioned and supported\u201d by Huston-Tillotson University, the East Austin university at which Professor Dumpster both teaches and serves as Dean of the University College.\n\u2014 Professor Dumpster owns four pairs of pants, four shirts, and \u201ceight or nine\u201d bow ties.\n\u2014 The dumpster has air conditioning.\n\u2014 There is no mention of the woman that took up the last third of Wilson\u2019s XOJane piece, who \u2014 as a recap \u2014 met Wilson when he invited her on a blind date to explore Europe for 21 days and told her she couldn\u2019t pack anything.\n\u2014 There\u2019s no mention of Wilson\u2019s daughter, either. Has her mother relented and allowed her to spend overnights in the dumpster with daddy?\n\u2014 The dumpster is still \u201ctucked behind the women\u2019s residence halls.\u201d\nWhat do you think? Is the tiny house movement laudable, or is there something about this dumpster project that stinks? Take a minute to read the Atlantic profile, and then we can come back and discuss Professor Dumpster together.\nPhoto: Wayne Wilkinson (NOT a pic of Prof Dumpster\u2019s dumpster, please go to the Atlantic piece to see those pics)\nSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.\nFree\nDistraction-free reading.

His goal is to live with 1% of what most Americans use in water, electricity, waste, and space.\nThe environmental science professor has already had to face flooding and temperatures reaching up to 124 degrees.\nWilson\u2019s biggest accomplishments so far include the first usable garden at the university in nearly 50 years, which is watered with condensation from a nearby AC unit, and a weather station that is attached to his dumpster.\nPhase two of this three step plan includes the addition of modern amenities, such as a hot water heater, a washing machine, and a dryer.\nProfessor Wilson\u2019s hopes his project will be an example for living a sustainable, albeit smelly, life.\n\u201cJust like Bill Nye the Science Guy or Mrs. Frizzle from the Magic School Bus, Professor Dumpster will engage with the next generation in creative thinking about the important topics of sustainability and science education,\u201d his website states.\nVia KENS.\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @samantha_reinis\nShare this article\nSamantha Reinis\nSouth Carolina Campus Correspondent\nView Profile\nFrom the Web\nPowered by ZergNet\nTim And Gwen Walz's Marriage Is Stranger Than We Ever Thought\nHere's What Jesus' Childhood Might Have Really Been Like\nInappropriate Outfits Lauren Boebert Has Been Caught Wearing\nWhat you stand for is what defines you\nConservative students on college campuses are marginalized, threatened, and silenced by threatening students who oppose their views, or radicalized leftist professors or administrators.

Featured recently over at Co.Exist, Prof. Dumpster (real name: Jeff Wilson), an environmental scientist over at Huston Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, plans to live in a souped up garbage can for a year, outfitting the 33-square-foot space with essentials like a shower, toilet, kitchen, and Wi-Fi. Over the course of the year, the professor\u2014a youngish guy with a goofy smile and thick-framed glasses\u2014aims to \"engage the next generation in creative thinking about the important topics of sustainability and science education,\" citing the likes of Bill Nye the Science Guy and Ms. Frizzle as influences.\nPer Co.Exist, Wilson came up with the idea while working on a paper in Starbucks: \"I looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight-yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that I was definitely moving into a dumpster.\" A year later he sold his belongings\u2014each item was $1\u2014and began living (clandestinely) in his office at the university. After seven months of that he bought and cleaned a used bin that, at 33-square-feet, measures just 1 percent the size of 2011's average new-built American home.\nFor the first phrase of the project, Wilson will be what he calls \"Dumpster camping,\" living in an empty shell, curled in a sleeping bag on the floor. Then he and his students will outfit the whole shebang in the types of modern conveniences that sap resources in regular homes: air conditioning, regular-bulb lighting, Xbox, and the like. It's all to establish a baseline for the final phase: an environmental impact makeover that brings in things like \"energy-producing\" toilets and nano-insulation to maintain temperature. (Yeah, OK, \"pimped out\" was the phrase Wilson used.) The plan is to travel around performing for kids in grades K through 12, even going into \"stealth mode\" and \"dropping it on a kids' playground and seeing what happens ... Because they're going to open the door and see an Xbox, a bed, a shower, all these things.\" More info, right this way.\n\u00b7 'Professor Dumpster' Is Moving Into A Garbage Can, And Bringing His Students With Him\n\u00b7 The Dumpster Project [official site]\n\u00b7 This tiny NYC abode is literally a Dumpster with a stove.

So, as eccentric professors tend to do, he moved into a 33-square-foot dumpster. Dr. Wilson affectionately became known as \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d after spending a year in the tiny dwelling.\nOver the course of 365 days, Wilson, or one of his students, spent every night in the makeshift home. The inhabitants of the dumpster had to make do with a small space, but they spruced up the place a bit. Solar panels and electrical connections were made in order for the trash container to have light and air conditioning. Other features include storage under a false floor and a weather station on the sliding roof door (it takes measurements every five minutes).\nThe dumpster sits on the campus of Houston-Tillotson University and will remain there, despite the end of the experiment.\nAlbuquerque Journal reports that Dr. Wilson will miss his time in the dumpster.\n\u201cThe last few nights have been really sweet\u2026 Identitywise, am I still Professor Dumpster if I\u2019m not living in a dumpster? I don\u2019t know if this is what my mom wanted for her first-born son.\u201d\nThe Dumpster Project was born out of a want to research sustainability. Wilson began with the hypothesis that \u201cone can have a pretty good life in and on a lot less.\u201d Essentially, the concept melted down into this: \u201cStuff is noise.\u201d Wilson and his students wanted to know if it was possible to live in a dumpster for a year, and what sort of challenges they would face in doing so.\nCongrats to @profdumpster, who just completed 1 year of living in a 33-square-foot dumpster! http://t.co/TwnPYLeeEc pic.twitter.com/DBrbQwdRFe\n\u2014 austin_monthly (@Austin_Monthly) February 5, 2015\nAccording toNBCDFW, a local NBC News affiliate, Wilson \u201cevicted\u201d himself on Wednesday during a reception on campus. The dumpster will be remaining on campus as a future teaching aid, and \u201cThe Dumpster Project \u2018Home\u2019 School\u201d will have curriculum on sustainability.\nEducators will be staying in the dumpster, according to Amanda Masino, who also teaches biology at Huston-Tillotson, and students will be given a \u201csemiridiculous challenge: Turn the dumpster into a house. What happens when you don\u2019t have constant temperature? Where do you get water? How do you treat it?\u201d\nWilson believes that having the dumpster on campus will help students understand sustainability better than \u201ctalking about it in a dry way.\u201d\nDr. Wilson did not spend the entire year in the dumpster himself. He estimates that he spent about 250 nights in the dwelling. Other nights he was travelling with his daughter or spending the night with his girlfriend. They couldn\u2019t exactly go to his place, now could they?\nDon\u2019t let the silliness of the experiment fool you; there was a more serious note to the experiment.\n\u201cIt pushes your limits. It totally blew up the idea of what a home is. In this climate, having central air and heat is more necessary than having a kitchen. But it would have been nice to have a toilet. The main complaint from students was a weak Wi-Fi signal \u2014 allegedly to do their homework.\u201d\nWilson will continue to be part of Project Dumpster, however, he has a new experiment to complete: spending 99 nights in a variety of homes all over Austin.\nWould you, or could you, spend a year in a space as small as a dumpster?\n[Image via Commons.wikipedia.org]\nShare this article: A Year In A Dumpster: Texas Professor Completes Experiment And Moves Out [Video]\nPopular On Inquisitr\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle Had an Explosive Argument and He Angrily \u2018Snapped at Her'\nMichelle and Barack Obama\u2019s Deeply Embarrassing Moment From Daughter Malia's Prom Night\nBrad Pitt Gifted Ex-wife Jennifer Aniston a $79 Million Home for Her 50th Birthday\nKris Jenner's Ex-Husband Robert Kardashian Was Allegedly Obsessed With 'Kinky' Priscilla Presley\nDonald Trump\u2019s Retort to Kamala Harris\u2019 DNC Speech Now a Running Joke on Social Media\nMore from Entertainment\nAbout Us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of use\nDMCA\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 The Inquisitr.

This experience made him embrace the minimalist lifestyle and inspired him to invent a micro-housing startup, called Kasita, in 2015. Measuring 31 x 12-feet, these tiny homes can be fitted or stacked over one another to serve as a function- home, workspace, and pop-up commercial space.\nThese prefabricated homes can be assembled off-site and delivered in two to three weeks. The stackable units can easily be installed almost anywhere on any terrain. Each unit has been designed to offer a sustainable, space-efficient and cost-efficient micro-living for changing city lifestyles.\nInside the modular units, you can find all essentials of a home, including bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen, and storage space. On raising the entry section, you\u2019ll find this underfloor storage that further leads to a sunken living/bedroom area, making the area appear more spacious.\nIt also contains a glass-clad cube-shaped section that offers undivided views of the surrounding landscape and also brings in natural daylight. The unique concept of the house also suggests a new form of real estate, allowing the homeowners to relocate their living space to any desired place. The energy is provided by directly plugging these units into any grid.\nBesides that, these micro-housing units can also be powered via renewable energies for off-grid, sustainable living. Some of these tiny homes will be ready for delivery in June 2017.

Harvard-educated Dr. Jeff Wilson started this project in February and is now famous among his students by the name of \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d. The purpose of this project is to show people that one can lead a pretty good life even in such conditions.\nCurrently, the dark green dumpster is parked in a corner of Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s campus behind the women\u2019s residence halls. According to Wilson, it is \u201cthe most thoughtfully designed tiniest home ever constructed\u201d. Before their professor moved in, the students of Wilson cleaned and fixed the place for him to make it fit for residing in. They are planning to set up solar panels and an energy-producing toilet to make the dwelling as energy efficient as possible.\nWilson started downsizing his place of living after his divorce, firstly moving from a 2500 sq ft house to a 500 square foot apartment and selling off all his spare clothes and furniture at $1 per item. It was soon after that he realized how little he needed to survive. Eventually, this played a vital role in implementing this dumpster living idea.\nWilson, who had lived in his office for seven months after the lease on his apartment ran out, admitted, \u2018Keeping that secret for seven months especially from the 3am cleaning staff and the 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself.\u2019 But soon he pitched in the dumpster idea and got the university to sanction it and support it. The project revolves around the concept that the person will live on 1% of everything a random American uses, that is 1% space, 1% water, 1% energy and also producing only 1% of waste.\n\u2018We could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d Wilson elaborated while explaining the perks of the dumpster home. \u201cFueled by sunlight and surface water, people could have a pretty good laugh.\u201d Being a minimalist now, Wilson only owns four pairs of pants, four shirts, three pair of shoes and a few bow ties. He stores all his worldly possessions under a false floor that was recently installed. His camping cooking equipment is also stored there.\nWilson got used to the place in a few months, and after installing some useful amenities, he started feeling comfortable at his new place. One of the first things was replacing the tarp roof with a sliding pitched roof with a weather station on top. Six months later, he fitted a modest air conditioner to cope with the extreme Austin heat.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make it too easy,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to see how elastic my sleeping habits would be relative to temperature and humidity. I found that I could actually get to sleep pretty well as long as I went to bed at about 11:00pm.\u201d He tracks his personal climate in real-time using the weather-related data acquired through the weather station.\nThe project declares that Wilson will receive more amenities like a bed, a lamp and a dome to catch rainwater and get shade. The dumpster will also be featuring a tiny sink, a kitchen and locks, making it the only dumpster in the world with interior locking system. But what he\u2019s eagerly waiting for is a toilet.\nHe currently uses the toilet at the university\u2019s gym, but \u201cgetting to the toilet sometimes requires kind of a midnight run,\u201d he said. It is believed that soon he\u2019ll be having his own toilet which will be connected to the dumpster externally. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to have a composting toilet inside of a closed-up 36 square feet,'\u201d he explained.\nThe third phase is to make the dumpster, \u2018an uber dumpster home\u2019. So it will be unplugged from the energy grid and solar panels will be installed to create its own energy and power itself. More aesthetic work is to be done as well, hence minimizing the dumpster effect. \u2018We kind of want to do the outside in a modern Dwell look,\u2019 he said. \u2018We want it basically to be such that if you were blindfolded and placed inside it, you\u2019d just think you were in a very tiny house.\u2019\n\u201cWe bring everything into the home these days,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need to leave home for anything, even grocery shopping, anymore. What\u2019s interesting about this (project) is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home. The big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is: can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less? So far, I have, I\u2019d say, a better life than I\u2019ve had before.\u201d\nWilson does have an arrangement in place in case he needs an occasional break from the project. His students occupy his place willingly for the night.\nHe is planning tours across the US to educate students about the concept of \u2018less is more\u2019, after this project year is over. He\u2019s already covering the local grounds for the time being, visiting the local elementary and middle schools to talk about his experience for the last year while elaborating on the fact that one can survive in a home without modern facilities and still lead a pretty good life. One of the questions he got asked was, \u2018How is Santa going to get in?\u2019\nTwitter\nFacebook\nGoogle+\nPinterest\nTumblr\nLinkedin\nReddit\nEmail\nPrevious article\n30 No Wallpaper Backgrounds For Free Download in HD\nNext article\n66 Dam Pictures Which Are A Piece of Engineering Marvel\nRelated Articles\nAmazing\nNew Dragon-Inspired Folding Knife Channels Your Inner Targaryen\nAmazing\nThis Rooftop EV Solar Box Unravels To 6x Its Size And Enables Off-Grid Charging\nAmazing\nThis Flimsy-Looking Suspension Bridge Is Probably The World\u2019s Scariest Bridge\n< Next article Previous article >\nLEAVE A REPLY\nComment *\nName *\nEmail *\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nRecent Posts\nTyping These Four Characters Could Crash Your iPhone\nChina\u2019s Manned Airship AS700 Achieves Completes Its Longest Flight Yet\nMark Cuban Has Asked Elon Musk To Post The X Algorithm Source Code\nWhy Some Physicists Think We Are Living Inside A Black Hole\nHigh-Tech Robot Conference In China Shows Off The Future Of Humanoid Robots\nTrending Hot Popular About Privacy Policy Contact Us\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Wonderful Engineering.

Jeff chose a dumpster as his new home as part of an experiment to test the limits of home. He and a couple of other professors along with students began with a 33 square foot dumpster, a clean one of course, and made it into a surprisingly livable space. Shop Tiny Homes Jeff gave away most of his possessions and moved into the tiny space he would call home for the year. The project was a way to highlight the housing issue in the United States and all over the world, a problem that is quite complex and actually fairly old. Jeff explained that real estate as an institution is centuries old, but many wealthy families store their money in real estate making it difficult for those looking to rent or buy homes and land. Jeff's goal has been to \"find the cracks in the system\" as he puts it, to make things a bit easier for the average person. If you look at home buying trends, you'll find that many younger people, particularly millennials, are not buying homes. They are already tied down with student loan debts which makes it almost impossible to save money and housing prices are way too far out of reach.\nSo it makes sense to find a new way to create affordable housing for people so that homeownership isn't such a far off dream which is where the tiny house movement comes into play.\nBut first, Jeff had to undergo his experiment in his very tiny space to wrap his head around downsizing in an extreme way. In 2014, he got his dumpster and put it on the university campus filling it with only the items he used regularly and that he loved. After a while he got the nickname \"Professor Dumpster,\" and he stayed in the dumpster turned tiny house pretty much every night for the entire year. He made the space feel larger by painting the walls white and adding in creative storage solutions which made the tiny house space more livable. Although, there were still things he absolutely couldn't fit into the tiny dumpster home. Of course, there was no practical way to add a bathroom or a kitchen in such a small space. So he instead used the dorm cafeteria as his kitchen and the gym at the school for his bathroom. It's quite impressive how he completely transformed the inside of this dumpster to make it totally liveable for sleeping and lounging. He added brightly coloured tapestries and fabrics that really brightened up the space and brought in some character.\nThe experiment focused on creating housing that is healthy for humans and the environment.\nIt expands our ideas surrounding what we call home by shrinking the footprint of our living space to allow for more financial freedom and less of an environmental impact. As Jeff lived in the dumpster tiny house, while he realized 33 square feet was much too small, he thought of different ideas to move this concept of small house living into a practical application, one that people could actually purchase and live in. So the Dumpster Project unfolded into Kasita, a company creating portable micro-apartments. Kasita could just be a solution to the housing issues we're facing at this time. The company makes 352 square foot tiny homes that are packed with technology and clever storage space. He showed one of the models at the 2017 South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas. These tiny houses would cost around $139,000 per unit which would make for a mortgage of only $800 a month plus any land leasing costs. That seems pretty reasonable, and much more appealing than living in a dumpster.\nPhoto Gallery\nPrevious Photo\nNext Photo\nTiny Houses\nThis Ultra Modern Tiny House Will Blow Your Mind\nTiny Houses\nLook Inside This Charming Tiny Cabin With Porch\nLog Homes\nMust See Gorgeous, Secluded Log Cabin on Over 6.5 Acres!\nLog Homes\nThis One-bedroom Cabin Is Cozy Yet Spacious With Everything You Need\nLog Homes\nA 660 Sqft Peaceful Log Cabin with Amazing Interior, Price Inside!\nTiny Houses\nSee This Cozy Tiny Cabin Sits on a 3 Acre Wooded Lot\nBarn Homes\nThis Meticulously Built Barn Has Incredible Interior Accents\nTiny Houses\nPeek Inside This 200 Sqft Lovely Tiny Cabin\nTiny Houses\nPerfect Beautiful Single Park Home with Superb Interior Design\nTiny Houses\nRustic Tiny Cabin Set on 10 Wooded Acres\nLog Homes\nEnter This 1 Bedroom Cabin: The Interior Is a True Dream\nTiny Houses\nLook Inside This Absolutely Gorgeous Handcrafted Hideaway Tiny House\nTiny Houses\nAmazing 400 Sqft.

ceo jeff wilson and his team at kasita have developed a modular, versatile, and transportable living unit self titled- kasita. the idea for the project came about after he spent an entire year living in a 33 ft2 dumpster to experiment with the possibilities and challenges of living in an extremely constricted space and come up with solutions to increase its functionality without compromising comfort. the modular pods measuring roughly 31\u2032 x 12\u2032 can be fitted to serve almost any function- home, workspace, pop-up commercial space \u2013 and can be installed almost anywhere and on any terrain. the project provides a sustainable, cost and space efficient solution for a growing population and changing lifestyles. \n\nthe concept could exist in just about any context around the world\nimage by kasita (also first images)\n  each unit contains the essentials for a home, a bedroom, bathroom, living room and kitchen, and storage space, as well as the \u2018cube\u2019 which is a glass-clad projection the provides views and natural light into the home. every part of the house serves at least one function, maximizing the efficiency of the space and allowing the inhabitant to determine their own aesthetic for living. the concept also suggests a new form of real estate, with the module small enough to fit on the back of a truck, when the owner wants to move they can take their exact same home with them and install it into a new location. a kasita can exist individually or clustered with others to make vertical structures as a modular apartment complex, adding to the usability in almost any urban context. \n\nimage by kasita\n  at the entrance located at one end of the rectangular footprint opens into a more concealed area naturally lit by slender clerestory windows. this space contains primarily the bathroom and kitchen area. raising the entry section provides for underfloor storage and leads to a sunken living/bedroom area that enjoys a taller space and more open feel. the cube is in turn raised off the ground once more providing further storage and a secondary space for various other activities. energy is provided by directly plugging into any grid but could also be powered through renewable energies, with engineered energy loads to properly run the space.\n\nimage by kasita\n\nimage by kasita\n\nimage by kasita\n\nimage by kasita\n\nimage by

Kasita\nJeff Wilson spent one of his two years as dean of Huston-Tillotson University in Texas living in a dumpster.\nAdvertisement\nThe experience made him embrace minimalist living, and inspired him to launch a tiny home startup, called Kasita, in 2015.\n\"While the experiment was extreme, the experience I gained by living small and simple made a big impression,\" said Wilson, who is a former postdoctoral researcher at Harvard and IBM project manager. \"At the end of the year, I left the dumpster with the concept for a new category of housing \u2014 a beautiful, small footprint home designed as a solution for the growing housing crisis.\"\nBased in Austin, Texas, Kasita offers housing units that can sit by themselves or stack to form apartments. The pre-fabricated homes can be assembled off-site and delivered in two to three weeks, Wilson says.\nIn 2017, the startup started selling its first tiny homes, which measure 352 square feet and cost $139,000. A newer iteration of the home \u2014 which features additional storage \u2014 was shown at this year's SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. The latest Kasita homes are now on sale for the same price.\nAdvertisement\nCheck out the newest units below.\nAdvertisement\nKasita sells tiny housing units. The startup gets its name from \"casita,\" the Spanish word for \"little house.\"\nKasita\nAt 352 square feet, white walls help the units look larger than they are.\nKasita\n(For comparison, the average one-car garage measures about 260 square feet.)\nAdvertisement\nThe main, open-layout space functions as both a living room and bedroom.\nKasita\nIn the model unit, a bed pulls out from the sofa (the units come unfurnished).\nKasita\nAdvertisement\nAcross from the living room, there's a sleek kitchen.\nKasita\nThere's an electric stovetop, full oven, and dishwasher, too.\nKasita\nAdvertisement\nAround the corner, there's a bathroom with a shower.\nKasita\nSince the units are so small, they are designed with space-saving storage.\nKasita\nAdvertisement\nDrawers are located inside stairs.\nKasita\nEach home also features tech integrations, including glass windows that adjust their transparency depending on the amount of natural sunlight.\nKasita\nAdvertisement\nThe unit also comes with an Amazon Echo Dot, which lets users control the home's systems with their voice.\nKasita\nKasita units can stack on top of each other to form a complex ...\nKasita\nAdvertisement\n... or they can sit on rooftops ...\nKasita\n... or in backyards.\nKasita\n\"We want to take the noise out of buying a home. Imagine how great it would be to be able to buy a home as easily as you buy a product,\" Wilson said. \"The long-term plan would be that you could just put in your address and credit card number and we would care of the rest.\"\nAdvertisement\nWilson got the idea for Kasita after living in a dumpster for a year in 2014.\nSarah Natsumi\nOwning a lot of stuff felt burdensome, so he sold the majority of his possessions and moved into (and renovated) the small, empty dumpster in Austin, Texas.\nSarah Natsumi\nAdvertisement\nHe says that the Kasita is both \"a product and a home.\"\nKasita\nFuture Kasita designs will evolve based on owners' needs and wants.\nKasita\nAdvertisement\n\"The way we build housing (and even skyscrapers) hasn\u2019t changed substantially in over 100 years, and a lot of that lag is because we haven\u2019t updated the way we approach building,\" he said.\nKasita\nRead next\nDesign\nAdvertisement\nRecommended video\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n* Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.

If anyone understands small scale living, it\u2019s company CEO Jeff Wilson \u2013 who lived in a 33 sq. ft. dumpster for a year in order to better understand the limits of habitable space.  The result incorporates all the comforts you might expect to relinquish in a tiny home \u2013 a queen-sized bed, kitchen, shower and washing machine \u2013 in an airy, open-feeling space.\nThe real beauty of Kasita is its tech integration.  It is a house that acknowledges we live in a technology-saturated time, and is designed to maximise and streamline the integration of a wide range of systems. The Kasita team developed special software that allows hundreds of pieces of technology that are normally incompatible to \u2018speak\u2019 to each other and operate together in a single system.  In its 30.2 square meters, Kasita integrates all the latest technology seamlessly into your living space; the entire home can be controlled by app or voice activation including lighting, audio, and home security.\nSHARE THIS POST:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nPREVIOUS\nEco5000\nNEXT\nMount Emerald Wind Farm\nBEC Supports Pyjama Foundation\nAs part of BEC\u2019s ongoing commitment to social responsibility, we supported the Pyjama Foundation in August.

My name is Charles Lowell, a developer here at The Frontside and your podcast host-in-training. With me today are Jeff and Jason from Kasita. Now, Kasita is one of the most exciting products that I think we've gotten to work on here at Frontside in the last five years. We're going to be just talking about it because, I think it touches on a lot of the aspects of what makes software development and startups and just the emerging economy exciting.\nI'm really thankful that we get to have you all on the podcast. Welcome Jeff and welcome Jason.\nJEFF: Thanks for having us.\nJASON: Excited to be here. Thanks, Charles.\nCHARLES: Now Jeff, you are the founder of Kasita, the CEO and I believe your official title over there is 'Professor Dumpster.' Maybe you could actually unpack for us a little bit of what does that title mean? How did Kasita come about and what is it today?\nJEFF: A couple of years ago, I did a radical, social experiment around housing. I went and sold everything I own for a dollar an item out of a 3000-square foot house and moved into a 33-square foot used trash dumpster for a year. The idea of that project was to live in 1% the size of an average American home and try to use 1% the energy and water of the average American home.\nThe project took a little bit of a twist, you might say and about part way through it when the dumpster started getting tricked out, I started thinking about the whole nature of housing and how we need to do something different and how that grand future probably would not be a gated community of dumpsters.\nCHARLES: Now, I assume you cleaned out the dumpster before you actually went to live in it.\nJEFF: Yeah, it was a fixer-upper. We give it a bit of a scrub and did some testing to make sure there wasn't anything nasty left in there. That went for about a year and a couple of months after that, I actually first set down with Jason because he was the only person that I knew in the entire startup scene, in the entire world. He said, \"Wilson, you had some crazy ass ideas like this dumpster thing you told me about. This one might actually work, this Kasita thing.\" Here we are today, we're working together.\nCHARLES: Wow. This was something you just did on a lark. You didn't have the idea of starting this business but it was actually through the process of actually living in this dumpster for a year that the idea emerged or was there a master plan going in?\nJEFF: I don't know, Jason do you remember any kind of master plan when I first told you about the dumpster?\nJASON: No. When we first met to talk about the dumpster, it was an early morning, I believe in 2010 or 2011 and you're incubating the idea. At that point in time, there was nothing on your mind or you aren't looking towards the future of housing at all. You were just trying to figure out how you were going to move into a dumpster and people thought you would be crazy. Of course, I've validate it and I thought people would think you would be crazy.\nCHARLES: That is a pretty radical idea, the future of housing being 1% of what it is now. How do you see that playing out? How is that possible? How do you shift people's mindset away from that?\nJEFF: One of the bigger things we're trying to do with Kasita, there needs to be a massive shift in the wider way that we live in our homes. As everything else is moving towards on demand and as a service and as everything's being sort of productized, those are some of the core ideas behind Kasita. We think about Kasita a lot more like an iPhone or a Tesla than we would think about it as a single family home or an apartment block or even a micro-unit. That's why Jason and I are standing together here today is I represent a lot of ways, a kind of vision and origin story of Kasita but in a lot of ways, Jason represents the future of the software and integrated IoT that's going into these things.\nCHARLES: There is definitely a lot going into these things. I remember when Jason first started telling me about it because it is like an iPhone or a Tesla but, I think especially the Tesla is a great analogy because you have not just like a normal software or even really a hardware project, you've got architectural concerns. You've got manufacturing concerns. You've got, I assumed geopolitical concerns in terms of the politics around zoning and housing and real estate, all rolled up into a big startup. When I think startup, I think let's get a web application up and running and we're providing some service. This is cross-cutting at least five industries, it feels like if not more. I'm curious, what's been the experience in terms of wrangling that aspect because I think it is very unique in a startup today but it got me wondering is this going to be the normal in five years?\nJEFF: We've seen a movement recently in the venture community. Even a few years ago when we first started raising money was highly-regulated industries are hard, hardware is hard, \"Thank you very much. We're going to go looking for our next two Stanford computer science dropouts to shove into a wee work and not have to deal with all of this kind of stuff.\" I think I've seen a shift to where people from the individual level up to the folks funding these things, see the massive opportunity in highly-regulated complex problems like housing and you're right. Jason and I are looking out over our shop floor here where we've got guys out there that are plumbers or traditional electricians all the way upstairs here to folks that have been mayor pro tem of large cities with PhDs. Bridging all of those individuals into a startup culture and then looking at the complexity of the landscape from a regulatory standpoint, autonomous cars are a breeze relative to the kind of complexity we're dealing with.\nCHARLES: Did you know this complexity walking in or was it a classic overoptimism?\nJEFF: No, it wasn't classic overoptimism. I'm always asked, \"Are you a designer? Are you an architect? Are you a real estate developer? Are you a technology guy?\" and I think if I would have been any of those besides a guy living in a dumpster, I wouldn't ever been crazy enough to try this.\nIt's one of our core precepts as well. Jason had never worked with IoT stuff before. Our head of manufacturing used to build LEDs for Philips. Our quality guy inspected Cadillacs. Our manufacturing engineer built Boeing jets. The ideas that we're not pulling a lot of people from these traditional industries, we're pulling smart people that are passionate about our mission and to solve this, what is really a Rubik's Cube of a problem.\nJASON: Yeah, I think the other thing to add to that that Jeff is not getting himself enough credit is that from very early on, Jeff always looked at Kasita as a product that was going to incorporate multiple disciplines. He was very careful in how he orchestrate it and built the team to make sure that he was bringing the right expertise and the right areas together and then forcing those different disciplines to figure out how to meld and work together to build the Kasita. But the Kasita was from the beginning just about building a micro-urban home. It was about building a product of which part of that was a home, where people live obviously, but there's a whole lot more to it that we're working towards. I think even go back and Jeff, it might be relevant for you to talk a little bit about the approach that you took to just create an initial design for Kasita, which I think is revolutionary in itself.\nJEFF: A big part of our DNA was product from conception. When I was living in the dumpster, I recruited a couple of the top architects in the country really to help me turn that dumpster into a home. The way you're trained in architecture school, I think a lot of folks come in there with Buckminster Fuller kind of dreams and you're told pretty quick that you better bring things up to code and you better make things that sell or you're not going to eat when you get out of here.\nThe idea was that we would start off with a product designer and not design a home. The kind of struggles in the dumpster taught me that we needed to go at a different approach so I went and recruited an industrial designer. One of the requirements for that person that he or she had never designed a home. This person had lived under a staircase and never designed a home so I said, \"You're perfect.\"\nCHARLES: I like that and I'm curious, Jason from your perspective, what was it like to have gone through this? It sounds like what you're doing is asking people to bring their expertise but not their set of expectations like the industrial designer. What was it like for you coming primarily from the software development world to step into this pan-technological realm and what was that experience like and what were the things that stretched you and you found surprising?\nJASON: I think early on, I realized that it was going to be a bit more challenging maybe than I thought. Really, what it required was me to think outside of my discipline. Obviously, not only from the perspective of what we were doing on the IoT frontend, how we were melding software and hardware together but then going all the way over to the physical building structure and thinking about on a weekly, daily, hourly basis on how we are interacting with the other disciplines.\nAn early example was, and this is one that I remember that's quite funny is one area that we wanted to make sure that we had covered in our research and understanding from IoT perspective was smart locks and how we were going to provide a smart locks for the data. We went out and did a lot of investigation, brought a number of leading smart lock solutions into the lab and tested them and narrow our list down. Then I recall vividly walking over to the architects to excitedly tell them we had selected our smart lock that we were going to use.\nThey very quickly inform me that that lock wouldn't work because we needed a mortise lock and not a standard door lock. I realized that you can't work in a vacuum and just solve your problems. You have to be working together to make sure the solutions and the products you're selecting at work in accord with the overall design. That's continued to manifest itself.\nEvery day, I'm down on the manufacturing floor, working directly with the electricians and others to make sure that our equipment is placed properly, where are we going to place our equipment, how are we routing around plumbing and pipes and other things that exist there and how are we locating things properly. It's an ongoing experience, which has definitely taken me out of my traditional software role but it's done so in a very exciting way and I've enjoyed it. It's just realizing that you have to actively be communicating across the organization with all groups and really, you can't take anything for granted.\nCHARLES: The number of different disciplines and technologies is really staggering, even if you limit it to just considering the set of devices that you're integrating. I was actually hoping we could talk a little bit about that. Now inside each Kasita, at least the ones that you're building right now, how many different devices do you have? How do you take all these different devices and turn them into a product or integrate them into something that itself is one product?\nJASON: If you were just to look at the technology bill of materials, what the products are that we're incorporating into our current Kasita design, there is around 50 different products and product parts that we're bringing together to build out the technology solution. If you narrow that down to what the end user is actually seeing and looking at, there are about seven noticeable products that the end user would see or they would recognize everything from a Sonos connecting amplifier to an Amazon Dot to a Nest Thermostat.\nObviously, getting to that list of bill of materials and deciding on that 'subassembly of technology pieces,' took us quite some time in a number of iterations and a lot of outside engagement and talking to experts and trying to decide what were the best devices to bring in. But the other side of the equation was something that we kind of decided very early on in the process and kind of thinking the world of first principles was that, we wanted to make sure that Kasita was the primary interface to the user. We didn't want somebody else sitting between us and the end user. We wanted to be able to work with other products but we still felt at the end of the day that the end user, when they were living inside of a Kasita, when they were controlling the Kasita, when they were changing the state of the Kasita, they needed to go through our interface.\nWith that as an initial first principle, you can begin to imagine that all the other parts of the system architecture and the way that we design things, the way that we select products and built things, it begin to derive themselves. Everything from that, immediately we needed an app and lo and behold. We were able, fortunately to work with you guys, the Frontside, to help us get our initial app concept up and going. It went from there and I can talk more about it.\nCHARLES: I think I really like that as a first principle. I really just want to inject a vigorous sense of agreement because I think it's so important, especially when this is the place where you're living. You want to imbue that inhabitant with a sense of ownership and control. I don't know if you would be able to do that if there were a bunch of different touch points and it didn't feel integrated under one product. In other words, this is my home, this is my Kasita. Is that the idea behind making sure that there was really only one interface?\nJEFF: We prefer to say 'Mi Kasita.'\nCHARLES: I love it.\nJASON: Absolutely, that's the idea. I think from a consumer perspective, if you've ever personally gone out and ventured through the halls of Home Depot or Best Buy and purchased some smart products off the shelf and brought them into your house and try to get them up and running, you very quickly learn that. It's not only challenging to get these devices connected in a way that you can control them but there's also this notion of there's an app for that. Every physical device you ended up putting in your how, has its own app for control and that becomes very overwhelming in a very short amount of time for the user.\nWe did not want that to be the case with the Kasita. We wanted them to walk in the door from day one and immediately feel at home and feel like they have complete control of the Kasita, in much the same way when you go purchase an iPhone or you purchase a new Garmin watch or you purchase a new Android device, you're up and running with that ecosystem and you're interacting with that interface. We wanted people to be interacting with the Kasita interface to control their home because that's part of the product.\nCHARLES: I like that. It must present some unique challenges because I think you said it best. Every single device that you have comes with its own ecosystem and that ecosystem has its own APIs, its own web interfaces, its own applications and though there are walls around those ecosystems, what are some of the challenges you encounter in trying to punch holes through those walls so that you can hand information and control from one ecosystem to the other while providing a seamless experience to the user?\nJEFF: When you're talking about that, Jason one of the things that is often left out of this equation is at this specific point in space-time, it's very difficult to do that. But then to have any sort of semblance of planning for the future and future-proofing the system as developers usually call it, one of the reasons why you don't see a lot of Nest thermostats in multifamily development is because a developer knows that they're not going to ever have to replace a normal light switch. If it's a Lutron switch or if it is a Nest thermostat at some point, it's going to have to be replaced. Not only the physical replacement of the stuff but from a software side, making sure that we can continue to communicate with these devices in the future, I think is a big problem to solve.\nJASON: That's absolutely right. I think very early on, we recognize and realize that we were going to have to build software and a component that acted, if you will as a gateway for sitting between the end user and the end devices and facilitated the control of the end devices. Obviously, being able to accomplish that, one of the challenges is and I think, Charles you've seen this in your world because I know you've got experience with IoT is this whole proliferation of standards and protocols like if we're going to talk to the lightbulb or we're talking via Z-Wave or ZigBee, or do we have to go through a Philips Hue hub because that's the only way to actually communicate with it. Is there a separate way via Thread or Bluetooth you communicate with this device?\nIn a very quick fashion, you get to this point where you can imagine that you've got a physical hardware controller that has four different radios in talking to four different device types. One for talking to Z-Wave, one for talking to ZigBee and it becomes overwhelming. We did a lot of research across the protocols that were available, mapping them across the devices. Early on, we were excited about the potential of Z-Wave but more recently, where we've shifted our attention quite honestly is looking for devices and device manufacturers who see the opportunity and Wi-Fi enabling their hardware devices and then providing either direct control of those devices in an IP-centric way over a local area network or even through the cloud.\nWhat that affords us back to Jeff's future-proofing concept is if you have Wi-Fi up and running and the device can get on the Wi-Fi network and there's a way to communicate with it, then it makes it a lot easier for us to sit between the user and that device and send commands and control that device. The other side of that, which I think continues to be a challenge and will be a challenged for the foreseeable future is a lot of the device manufacturers to the point that you brought up are still forcing you to go through the cloud to communicate with their devices. They don't allow for a local area network communication directly with the device and there's good reasons for doing that. But what that means is if you lose internet connectivity, you no longer have control of that device.\nCHARLES: Obviously, you've got probably pretty strict criteria about what it takes for a device to be integrated with Kasita. Is that a nonstarter right there?\nJASON: It's actually not. A nonstarter with be the device communicates via protocol that we can't interface with or the device works over a Wi-Fi network but has no API for controlling cloud or local. The third piece of that equation and fundamentally is the final nonstarter and really probably should be the first one and it's one that we take into consideration every time is that there should be a physical override for the user if internet connectivity is lost. What I mean by that is if we select a smart switch and the smart switch goes offline and there's no more connectivity, the user has still be able to walk to the wall and press the power button and the light should come on.\nThere always has to be an ability for the user to fall back to the same old fashioned physical control in the absence of Internet connectivity or local area network connectivity. But the primary things are ability to fall back to physical control, ability to communicate over Wi-Fi or standard IP-based protocol, then the third one would be some form of API access, either remotely via the cloud or locally via the local area network.\nCHARLES: Wow, that's actually a great list. It's got me wondering, obviously you've encountered devices that have fallen on both sides of that divide. Do you feel like that's just a blip and we're going to be trending more towards devices that are happily and easily integrated or are we still seeing some moving and jostling as people maybe try and corner little parts of the market and make their device deliberately make it not easy so that you'll try and force people into that ecosystem?\nJASON: The latter, however we have two guerillas in the market right now that I think are helping drive the other direction in the way of Amazon and Google with Google Home and Amazon Echo. What they're doing is they're saying, \"If we sit in the center and one of the interfaces for voice control for the user to control their home, then we're only going to work with devices that we can communicate with and that we can control through the cloud,\" and quite frankly, what that does is it puts the burden back on the device manufacturer.\nYou could actually say three if you threw Apple in there. I don't want to leave Apple out with HomeKit. But my point is that the device manufacturer now has to find a way that the end device can either communicate via standard TCP/IP network-based connectivity that we all know and love from a developer community perspective or they have to insert a hub into the equation that can handle that form of communication and then communicate over its own proprietary wireless connection, which is in the case of Philips Hue, it's exactly what they do.\nJEFF: I would draw analogies here to some people get really tired of this, particularly the real estate people of me talking about the iPhone but that kind of leap into and integrated piece of hardware and software. There were certain things happening in 2007 that didn't make the iPhone or something like it, something that might happen but something that had to happen. This kind of cold death to the universe that we could see with all of these walled-off ecosystems, go in their directions and iterating into a space to a nobody owns anything and nothing talks, I think Kasita is a solution to that to where we're looking like combine all this stuff under one roof and build a single user experience, much like not having to pull your Palm Pilot out of one pocket, you're Rio MP3 player out of another and you're your Razor or whatever it was out of the other like integrating into a single experience, rather than a sort of convenience, which is what a lot of the IoT spaces right now in these walled-off ecosystems.\nCHARLES: That actually makes a lot of sense and clarifies it in my mind quite a bit. It clarifies one thing but then, immediately raises new questions. When the iPhone first came out, you had a set of basic integrations between your MP3 player and your web browsing and your calling and calendaring, so and so forth. Then, I don't know what was it like, a year and a half later, they actually came out with an SDK so that you could actually develop apps -- third-party developers could actually develop. Sell and distribute in apps -- to the iPhone. We're all really happy with the way that worked out.\nI guess my question is does this analogy carry forward then also for Kasita? Is there a future where you have third-party developers who are actually selling integrations or apps that would run on this integrated IoT product that is Kasita or am I stretching the analogy too far?\nJASON: I think the analogy is good with the exception that we're not looking to control the entire IoT ecosystem in a way that Apple maybe had look to control the mobile phone ecosystem with providing all of that in one box and the iPhone. We want to work with numerous hardware providers and even from that perspective, numerous folks that want to provide interfaces into our system. As we develop an architected Kasita technology system, we've taken an API-first approach and that's allowed us to build our user application layer right on top of that API but in the future, we see the opportunity to work with third-party developers to extend that, up on that and build their own interfaces to the end user.\nThen on the other side of the equation, if you think about what's actually controlling the devices, we're architecting that system in a way that a hardware manufacturer could take an SDK and add Kasita support for their product directly in and make it plug and play when it gets to the Kasita. We definitely see the opportunity, Charles to reach out and allow everybody to be part of this. We consider it quite frankly, a necessary thing. But we don't also want to pretend that we would look to control the whole ecosystem because we just don't have that level of scale, if you will.\nJEFF: And you know --\nCHARLES: Not yet.\nJEFF: Yeah, and we try to keep our ego in the dumpster, so to speak as well.\nCHARLES: What would a third-party app even look like in the context of Kasita? Have you thought of like what are some things that you might be able to do?\nJEFF: If you don't want to call it directly an app, I think the first stage -- Jason and I haven't talked about this -- maybe more like an Alexa Skill to where you can have the Kasita do certain sets of tasks around a particular experience, which we're already building into the system the idea of moods but I don't know in terms of apps.\nJASON: Yeah, it's actually a really good idea. Even though we haven't talked about it, it always scares me a little bit when my boss is coming up with ideas on the fly that we have to implement but --\nJEFF: But actually we will have our first -- we're going to call it a skill app, a Kasita skill app. We'll be releasing that say, October 1st.\nCHARLES: You heard it here first, folks.\nJASON: To take Jeff's idea a little further, I think that is an interesting concept when you think about the Kasita as being an end product and you provide interfaces whether it's the ability for people to write skills that tie into the Amazon Echo or an IFTTT-type capability. The Kasita, as a whole can be controlled -- all the lighting, the sound, all the different temperature, etcetera -- so now you're asking end users to write skills, to control the entire state of the building or of the home and not just doing it on a one-off basis writing skill to turn this light on and off or set the thermostat to this level. You basically box all of that together and make it much easier for people to get from Point A to Point B through our system.\nJEFF: Could you say that we're turning the entire Kasita into a board for people to play with, like treat the Kasita as your breadboard?\nJASON: I think there is some opportunity for that to the degree that will allow the user to have that much flexibility on the hardware side. I think it is still up for question but I think there's a lot of opportunity there, Charles and not only inside of the Kasita but then you can begin to see other applications as Kasita begin to multiply and people use them from many purposes. Let's take a sample of somebody owns 10 Kasitas and they use them as Airbnb properties and they allow users that live in Kasitas to come in for a short period of time into their Kasita and bring their Kasita profile with them. Immediately, they can make the Airbnb Kasita feel exactly like their Kasita feels when they're at home. Those are some interesting opportunities and ways that we see this technology potentially evolving.\nCHARLES: So it will have the same moods, the same behaviors. Any customizations or third-party extensions would also be in effect provided they were software-based?\nJASON: Yep.\nCHARLES: That would actually be quite amazing. I guess the other question I have in terms of hackability of Kasita is we're very interested in the IoT space and very interested in these products and we have some side projects here at Frontside also like I do a bunch of hobby stuff at home, where I try to integrate a bunch of these things. But one of the things that I really like about what you all are doing is that it's very much 'omakase' in the sense of there's an option of 10 smart locks, there's an option of this thermostat, there's an option of a million different devices but what we've done or what you've done is selected ones that we know are going to work well together.\nWe've built the software, the control systems, both computer control systems and human control systems to get them to work together as a cohesive product. I would love to do is say, \"I would just like to buy that product for my house,\" even though my lame tinkerings with smart switches, smart locks and audio controls and lighting, which are fun and gratifying the first few times but they don't really play nice together, give you that super sweet feeling.\nJEFF: This goes to the overall philosophy of Kasita. We want a turnkey, one-click housing solution. Not only for finding you a place to rent so that you're not fishing around on Craigslist for roommate or having to pay some outrageous fee in New York. You don't have to go mattress shopping. At some point, you should just have to show up with your iPhone and your toothbrush. When you start thinking about the technology inside, it's almost like folks don't really care what kind of Foxconn chip is in their iPhone or even if it was Foxconn that put it there, they just want it to work and they want it to be seamless and turnkey.\nIt sets up a whole philosophy around, not only our smart kid in the Kasitas but it shouldn't even be a smart kid anymore. At some point, it should just be an experience so ultimately, what sort of UX inside of the Kasita are all of these things bringing you. I shouldn't have to really look at a blue glowing dot that lights up every time I walk by it to be at a comfortable temperature in my house. I shouldn't need a black tube over on my desktop that I yell commands at. I just talk or it should anticipate those actions. That's a future that I look forward to in Kasita to where we move away from having to tinker with devices and even knowing what those devices are to a true-like depth of experience.\nCHARLES: I like that a lot. Now, one thing that we haven't covered. We touched on it a little bit at the very beginning of the show when we talked about people feeling in control and feeling like they're truly the owner of the space is the issue of privacy. Obviously, there's a lot of a user's behavior that's going to be passing through software channels as their intentions move through the devices in the Kasita. Of course, all of these devices, they have their own ecosystems, their own vendors so how do you ensure that people's data is going to be protected, especially as it moves through potentially a bunch of different public clouds.\nJEFF: Yes, we gave a lot of thoughts to this. Actually, Jason put me on to this book called 'Data for the People' by Andreas Weigend. We took some inspiration on that, from that and set out on what we call it the four cornerstones of this future of the connected home. Those are agency, transparency, security and then the actual benefit that you get from this home. I gave a talk at South by called, 'The final frontier of AI is in your living room.' If that isn't black mirror, creepy enough to attract enough people, I don't know what is.\nIn that talk, I won't take them out of order. First, we need to make sure that we're focused on transparency. Do people know what's actually being collected on them? I've been toting around my iPhone for 10 years. I'm pretty sure they know everywhere that I have been since then. I'm not really all that sure. Second, agency. Can I actually do something about it? Are we allowing people the ability to switch off, switch on, control where that data goes?\nThen third, security. Are we providing another level of security above what you would get out of the box? I'll let Jason talk about that in a minute. Then, the last is benefit. Am I getting ads? Am I getting a slightly better news feed focused on ads or am I getting my rent subsidized? Am I getting a better user experience, better sleep within the connected home? Those are the ways that we think about that in a bigger level.\nCHARLES: Is the idea that there's no benefit than it's exploitative? You want to make sure that there's benefit?\nJASON: Yeah, I think that onus is if you taking individual data and using it, then the onus is on you as a data collector to try to provide benefit back to the end user. If you can't do that, then I think the question should be why are you collecting the data in the first place? our goal is really looking at it from the perspective of if we know when users are turning lights on and off and what they're setting the temperature in their house to and when they're going to sleep at night, when they're waking up because we know when they turn everything off and turn it back on --\nJEFF: Or where this things on the floor are from the vacuum robot.\nJASON: Yeah, exactly. If we have insight into that information, how are we taking that information and combining it in a valuable way that benefits the end user? I think that's the first question that we have to ask when we start looking at the data that we're collecting. But at the same time as Jeff said, that data collection really has to be based on this notion of agency, transparency and privacy or security. An agency is simply I have control over whether my data is collected. Transparency, from the perspective of I understand how my data is being used and where it's being sent and then of course, security, I know that my data is being securely transmitted and stored.\nWhen you think about security, we spend a lot of time thinking about not only the data at rest -- once it's been collected is it properly being stored and encrypted and protected -- but then how is that data being transmitted and are we putting the proper fail safes in place to make sure that somebody else can easily gain access and take control of my home and of the things that are important to me by finding back doors into the system and ways to breach them? Those are the cornerstones that we think about and we put first and foremost in our mind as we build out our architecture, build out our system and as we begin to take that data and to turn it back in useful and interesting ways for the end user.\nCHARLES: I think that's really important. I think it's a great comfort to hear that you all have a framework for thinking about this so that it's going to be integrated into every aspect of it. I think it's just so important, especially when it's something as critical as the space in which you're living. It's good to hear that it's not just an afterthought but that it's something that's been integrated from the start.\nWell, Jeff, Jason thank you guys so much for coming by and talking with us. I really think that Kasita is an exciting product and I think that it was an exciting project, certainly for us to get to work on, even though we were only seeing a very small sliver of it. We still got to perceive the whole enchilada that you guys were working on and see that just what a unique startup that really is, not just you're moving outside of software, integrating a bunch of different devices, integrating that with a unique home that's going to be designed, architected, manufactured and then thinking, then even rolling it up a degree further about how is this going to be integrated into the urban spaces in which we live.\nI hope that we see more startups that really engaged all those different disciplines. I think that with the technological changes that are happening, that's more and more a possibility. The price on software, the price on materials, the price on these smart devices is all coming down so it really enables people to take on scopes that might have been just completely impossible, even with someone who's overly optimistic. I hope that people look to it as an inspiration and it really was a great project for us to work on. I also understand that if someone does want to jump into this space and get involved, you all are hiring.\nJEFF: That's right. We are hiring for a broad range of positions. We're expecting to be doing a lot, more hiring soon. You can go to Kasita.com/Work and at the bottom of the page, you can also see that we have an open house here in Austin every Thursday morning from 9:30 to 11:30. The folks can come in and check out the crib.\nCHARLES: All right. Fantastic. I certainly really enjoyed getting the tour the space, what was that? Back in March? When you revealed the baby units?\nJEFF: Yeah, it was March at South by.\nCHARLES: Yeah, it's really something to see. If you are in Austin or you live here, take the time, go see it. It's really cool. With that, I guess we'll wrap it up. Thank you everybody for listening and as always, you can get in touch with us at @Frontside on Twitter or Frontside.io or send us an email at Contact@Frontside.io.

Benji Miller, director of operations, estimates that they produce roughly one unit per week right now. He also says approximately half of the company\u2019s backlog orders are California-based.\nThe Kasita concept is that a single unit can be plopped down to serve as a single home all on its own\u2014probably as a backyard in-law or cottage, zoning permitted\u2014or that developers may stack the modular homes into multi-family building designs.\nMiller says the company considers four- to five-story buildings ideal, noting that at around 75 square feet it starts to become more challenging and expensive to keep the structure sound. He estimates construction time at about half that of standard means.\nAs for the tiny apartment interiors, a Kasita home is essentially a portable showcase of modern apartment aesthetics, with the modular, encased quality of the unit giving the impression that NASA is getting ready to fire contemporary design trends into space.\nEach home is also wired so that Alexa or a similar home assistant can operate the lights and appliance with a single command.\nBut the real pitch is the efficiency of the layout, which turns the claustrophobic-sounding 350-plus-foot specs into something that seems larger and more humane through its tall 11-foot ceilings, large projecting windows, and elevated spaces that break up the boxiness of the design while also providing underneath storage.\nAlthough it\u2019s healthy to be skeptical of micro-home entrepreneurs who come to town with promises about how it\u2019s \u201creally not so small once you\u2019re inside,\u201d the truth is the interior of a Kasita really is surprisingly comfortable relative to the capsule-like exterior.\n\u201cWe had 25 people in here this morning and it didn\u2019t even feel uncomfortable,\u201d Wilson bragged on a Mission Bay tour of the micro-unit.\nEven the bathroom can accommodate four standing people simultaneously\u2014should it need to, for whatever reason.\nPrefab homes seem like an attractive idea for housing-starved Bay Area metros. But more often than not, cities fail to actually bite when the offer is made. In 2015, CityLab pooh-pooed Kasita as \u201ca solution search of a problem.\u201d\nBut more sympathetic outlets like Forbes hailed the homes as an answer to the \u201cmobility-starved void in the dead center of one of the largest segments of the U.S. economy.\u201d And Wilson remains confident that the Bay Area will turn up for Kasitas in the near future, as both technology and growing necessity develop.\n\u201cBuilding single family homes in downtown San Francisco isn\u2019t going to solve anything,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat we have here is a solution.\u201d\nKasita FAQ\nAustin is about to get its own prefab tiny home manufacturing facility [Curbed Austin]\nTiny homes get more versatile, affordable with Austin company\u2019s new modular line [Curbed Austin]\nThe Dumper Project [Huston-Tillotson University]\nThe Simple Life In a Dumpster [Atlantic]\nWhy Modular Apartments Wont\u2019 Work [CityLab]\nMeet Kasita [Forbes]\nNEXT UP IN SAN FRANCISCO MICRO APARTMENTS\nMaybe underground \u2018sleeping pods\u2019 in the Mission aren\u2019t a bad idea after all?\nSan Francisco apartments are shrinking in size\nRemembering earthquake shacks, San Francisco's original tiny homes\n\u2018Tiny homes\u2019 make up less than two percent of SF sales\nFour-story Berkeley building built in four days\n240-square-foot Russian Hill studio asks $379K\nRecommended\nMalaysia steps up pro-Palestinian stance, straining ties with U.S.\nNikkei Asia\nSpace-Saving Beds That Will Transform Your Home in Singapore - Prepare to Be Amazed!\nFolding Beds | Search Ads\nNew Senior Apartments in Singapore: Comfortable and Affordable (See Prices for 2024)\nSenior Living | Search Ads\nIBM to close China R&D operations, affecting 1,600 workers: reports\nNikkei Asia\nThe Average IQ in Singapore is 108.

After burying his Rolex in the desert, Wilson eventually found himself as a dean of a university with the novel concept of living in a dumpster.\nSarah Natsumi\n\"The idea was to test the absolute limits of what one needs to have a pretty good life,\" Wilson told Tech Insider. \"And although it wasn\u2019t originally aimed at housing, the idea around housing evolved from it.\"\nSo Wilson sold the majority of his possessions for a dollar a pop, getting the word out by posting a Facebook message his students could see. He showered at the University and fit the rest of his personal belongings in a backpack.\nSarah Natsumi\n\"One night, lying on my back in the dumpster staring up at the stars as we all do, I had that 'aha' dumpster epiphany, if you will,\" he said. \"There was something here to solve for one of our country\u2019s biggest problems.\"\nAdvertisement\nSo Wilson set off to design KASITA \u2014 a 208-square-foot home that can easily be set up and moved anywhere.\nKasita\nIt has a bathroom, a kitchenette, study, and a lounge. There's also a tucked away queen-sized bed that comes with a Casper mattress.\nKasita\nAdvertisement\nBut the KASITA homes also come with high-tech perks, like a Nest thermostat, Amazon Echo, and special glass developed by SageGlass that changes shade based on how bright it is outside so you don't need blinds.\nKasita\nThe homes also comes with Philip Hue Lighting that lets you control the color and intensity of your lights using an app.\nAll of the technology included in the home will be integrated into a central, KASITA app so it's easy to control your home's settings, Wilson said. A lot of the features can also be operated using voice command, he added.\n\"What I wanted to do was design, essentially, an iPhone that you could live in,\" Wilson said. \"Something that\u2019s beautifully designed, mass manufacturable, [and] affordable to a much wider group of people than the traditional thing you would see.\"\nKasita\nAdvertisement\nThe KASITA homes will be sold directly to consumers in the Fall, but Wilson declined to give a specific date as to when they'll be available.\nKasita\nAs for price?\n\"It will be about the price of a mid-range Tesla, except this is a home,\" Wilson said. He declined to give a specific price, but the lowest price for a Tesla is the $35,000 Model 3.\nWilson said KASITA will work with buyers to find and purchase the land to place their KASITA homes.\nKasita\n\"What we ended up with is a new way of thinking about the home as more like a product than a pile of bricks and sticks stuck to a particular piece of land,\" he said. \"Something that\u2019s more personal, that you know, that knows you, that integrates more with the person that you are.\"\nRead next\nHousing\nHousing Affordability\nAdvertisement\nRecommended video\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\n* Copyright \u00a9 2024 Insider Inc.

Now, the Texas-based environmental science professor has launched a prefab housing concept.\n  The project, dubbed Kasita, aims to resolve the difficulties people face when attempting to get on the housing market. Its inception also reflects society\u2019s changing attitude towards home ownership.\n  Described as \u201chousing-as-a-service\u201d, Kasita is composed of a prefab module which can be transported by truck from one location to another. Different sites would be setup to act as hubs \u2013 a place where Kasita\u2019s can be \u201cplugged in\u201d to a vertical rack of homes. Its kind of like a vertical trailer park.\n  The Kasita contains a 208 square foot (19.3 square meters) living space with an interior kitted out with space-saving furniture and storage units. There\u2019s a sofa-bed that can be rolled under a platform, as well as flexible storage wall that allows you to swap out tiles in place of shelves, storage boxes, or hanging pins.\nBeing a home of the future, it\u2019s also equipped with several smart technologies that will allow the occupant to control a host of features from their smartphone. Technologies slated for use include a Nest thermostat, wifi-enabled lighting and dichromic glass in the solarium to control light levels.\nThe concept opens up doors for new ways of living. You could own a Kasita module itself, or perhaps a rack in the steel tower which could be rented out when it\u2019s not in use. A reoccurring theme among these projects is the ability to live in different places \u2013 you find it in tiny houses, the recent co-living buildings and now with Kasita.\nIf you\u2019re interested, you can visit the prototype in Austin, Texas. The team behind the project are also intending to create a 320 square foot version, along with a wheelchair-accessible model. The aim is to create the homes in large quantities on a production line in order to reduce the cost. The pricing has yet to be revealed.\nFor more tiny houses check out The Basecamp, a tiny house built for and by a pair of mountaineers.

Now like never before you can literally move your entire apartment from one city to the next with the push of a button. The design of the tech-packed home was inspired by Wilson\u2019s radical experiment in apartment living when he spent the better part of a year living in a converted dumpster. The alternative lifestyle was supposed to provide commentary on the excessiveness of the typical single-family house, but it did far more than that.\nAfter ten months of dumpster dwelling, Wilson, who\u2019s also an environmental science professor at the Huston-Tillotson University, identified an interesting opportunity to rework the micro-apartment concept into something totally new and innovative. He recognized that while peeing in a bottle everyday was less than ideal, there were other benefits that dumpster living provided for him. First, he was able to live anywhere he wanted considering the size of his home, which also allowed him to get rid of his car; and second, he significantly trimmed down his possessions to accommodate the lack of space and storage. He used these observations to conjure up the future of the tiny house.\nThe design team at Kasita set out to create the ideal compact home through an approach deeply anchored in industrial design. Wilson choose to work with industrial designers over architects because he wanted to avoid expected solutions.\nThe 208 square feet that make up the tiny casa has been carefully crafted to the last cubic inch with a focus on elegance, comfort and function. Seriously, the apartment will literally welcome you home by adjusting the A/C, bringing up the lights and shades, and queueing your favorite playlist.\nPlus once they have the ball rolling in more than one city, you can move your unit from one location to another with your smartphone and the Kasita app. Read more about this awesome project and stay up-to-date as to when a Kasita will be available in your neighborhood on their website.\nRELATED:\nTiny 269-Square-Foot Mobile Home Finds Space for All Your Modern Amenities\nCity\u2019s First Micro-Apartment Project \u2018MY Micro NY\u2019 Ready for Stacking\nNYC Dumpster Transforms into an Inflatable Urban Education Classroom\nExplore NYC Virtually\nBy providing your email address, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

But one of the most innovative ideas was birthed right here in Austin; in a dumpster! Jeff Wilson, better known as Professor Dumpster, is showing off his small homes Friday, the day Kasitas go on sale. \nAuthor: Ashley Goudeau\nPublished: 7:22 PM CST March 10, 2017\nUpdated: 7:22 PM CST March 10, 2017\nJeff Wilson is taking the concept behind a \"casita\", Spanish for \"small house\", to a whole new level.\n\"It's the smartest home in Austin, maybe one of the smartest homes in the world,\" Wilson says while standing outside the prototype for his line of homes called Kasita.\n\"Generally you've got your, you know Alexa, you have these smart bulbs, you maybe have a Sonos system but it all doesn't talk together,\" Wilson said.\nInstead of building a house and filling it with smart technology, Wilson and his team built a home around technology.\nKasitas have one app that manage the entire home. It can show you who's at the door and let you talk the person outside or change your home's settings.\n\"Your 'welcome home' button flashes on all the lights. It puts on the fan,\" said Wilson.\nIf you want to set the mood, there's a button for that.\n\"If you hit 'date night' on the app,\" Wilson said as he hit the button. Marvin Gaye's \"Lets Get It On\" started playing and the lights dimmed.\nIf you're looking to do something more casual with friends, Wilson recommends selecting \"movie time\". This causes the television to rise out of a cabinet and start playing.\nThe Kasita prototype is a much nicer place to live compared to where Wilson was sleeping back in 2014\nBack then, the Huston-Tillotson professor was known around town as \"Professor Dumpster\". He was teaching his science students about sustainability and minimalism by living in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year.\n\"While I was in the dumpster, I had the thought that why don't we think about homes like iPhones,\" said Wilson.\nMeaning why don't people make them on a manufacturing line and design them in a way that ensures every inch of space is utilized.\nThe couch in a Kasita turns into a queen size bed. The stairs are really storage. All of the windows in the home dim with the touch of a button or go completely clear.\nThere's no denying the tech innovations inside Kasitas are cool, but for Wilson, the real purpose is to make housing affordable and accessible.\n\"We're not just looking at making cheap housing, we're looking at how land works, how the whole financing system works, how energy works. Coding and permitting and all these things tied together is what 's brought us into this housing, it's not even a crisis, it's a catastrophe,\" Wilson said.\nHis homes offer middle class people and couples an affordable option to live small. Wilson says they are ideal for someone who likes to travel or someone who enjoys spending time in their community rather than in the house.\nThe Kasitas go on sale Friday for $139,000. They can be reserved with a $1,000 refundable down payment. The units are 352 square feet and can fit in a back yard or small lot. They also can be stacked on top of each other. All of the homes are built in Austin, Texas.\nWilson said he hopes to one day use Kasita to address homelessness and even have larger units for familes.\nClick here to read more about Kasita\nClose Ad\nWhat's the most effective method to generate a monthly secondary income?\nCommitTips\n|\nSponsored\nLearn More\nUS Citizens in Singapore can still vote in 2024.

While the idea was slightly ahead of its time, sales were about what management wanted.\nSelling most of their product in and around the Austin, TX area, they continued to make improvements after the city passed legislation to allow ADU homes. \nRelated article: A Modular and Tiny House Disruptor Spreading Its Wings\nBut all that has changed this year. New owners, Kenny Tomlin and Richard Lent\u2014who also own the Kimber Modern boutique hotel in South Austin\u2014became co-owners of Kasita.\nThey decided the hospitality industry is a better direction for the company and stopped all single family housing at Kasita. \nIndividual Kasita units are now hotel suites, intended to be grouped and operated as a sort of hotel compound, with guests staying in individual, detached units rather than a single building. \nGuests will use various technologies come and go independent of any staff\u2014not unlike the intended independent, tech-based experience at the newly opened Arrive East Austin\u2014although there will be common areas available to guests as well.\nTheir new website indicates that the company intends to expand beyond the first hotel in Austin to San Antonio, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Portland, Oregon; Bentonville, Arkansas; and San Diego, California.\nThe old Kasita is dead, long live the new Kasita.\n\nGary Fleisher (the Modcoach) is a housing veteran, editor/writer of Modular Home Builder blog and industry speaker/consultant. modcoach@gmail.com\nShare\nTweet\nPREVIOUS\nFive Things I Wish I Had Known Before I Built My House\nNEXT\nKevin O\u2019Leary Explains Why Trade Schools are a Great Way to Earn High Wages\n2 Responses\n2morrow Studio says:\nAugust 7, 2019 at 3:15 pm\nSort of a pity. We all wring our hands about the housing crisis here and there; the \"missing middle\" and the need for density. But whenever a product like Kasita's affordable single bedroom/ADU comes along, there's always another market segment that will support a bigger markup\u2026in this case hotels and motels. So the work of creating affordable, accessible, vibrant neighborhoods is once again backlisted.\nAh well, I guess our school teachers, firemen, nurses and construction workers can always rent a unit from the \"hospitality industry\".\nLog in to Reply\nAnonymous says:\nAugust 8, 2019 at 4:14 am\nActually, this product wasn't affordable. It was based on a dumpster and sold for $140,000 at the factory. Now add the site costs and land and this was going to be sold for over $200,000 landed on a building site with just over 300 sq ft of \"living space\". Because it was modern and had some private equity funding it got some press. But, this wasn't real middle class modular. Middle class modular isn't sexy so it doesn't get a second look from the press or investors.

It has spawned books, television shows, and countless internet stories about \"going small.\" Despite this, we promise you've never heard of anything like Kasita. This Austin, Texas based micro-housing startup is shaking up the market with its 31' x 12' portable smart home. Launched last year by former professor Jeff Wilson and his team, Kasita can be customized to serve a number of needs, whether it be for a residence, an office, or a pop-up shop\u2014and it can be installed virtually anywhere. Small enough to fit on the back of a truck, it's incredibly easy to transport. Additionally, it contains all the essentials you need for a functioning home: a bedroom, bathroom, living room, and kitchen\u2014there is even storage space, air conditioning, and a washer/dryer. Even the appliances and electronic features (think glass windows with adjustable transparency and Amazon voice controls) are up to the latest smart-home technological standards.\nUntil they're produced and ready for pickup, you can reserve an individual Kasita (or multiple units to install in a group) for a $1,000 fee to hold your place in line. Once they're made, a Kasita can be yours for an additional $139,000.

Kasitas that would be based on the 352-square-foot prototype parked on an East Austin lot were projected to cost around $139,000 (which didn\u2019t include purchasing the land they would stand on, of course\u2014although at the time changes in Austin\u2019s zoning ordinances were starting make the more widespread use of accessory dwelling units on residential properties possible).\nBy 2017, Kasita was a national phenomenon\u2014at least in the press, think tanks, and the academy\u2014if not yet one that was actually producing and selling a lot of its streamlined, modern tiny homes. Touted as the \u201ciPhone for housing\u201d (it was 2017), the Kasita model and its touted revolutionary potential were featured, praised, and debated in multiple media sources, including CityLab and the New York Times. Its tours, collaborations, and activations during SXSW were big hits for a couple of years. Curbed and the Verge even produced and aired a video about Kasita for their Home of the Future series.\nThroughout 2017 and into 2018, the company continued to announce advances such as moving to a stackable version of its modular units that would be more affordable than the originals, expansion to other states, and the start of production in its own manufacturing facility. Around the start of 2019, the buzz around Kasita quieted considerably, and, if LinkedIn is any indication, Williams\u2019s tenure as CEO seems to have ended late last year.\nBy June, Kasitas were appearing on the MLS, brokered by real estate professionals, not the company. According to the company\u2019s new website, \u201cserial entrepreneurs\u201d Kenny Tomlin and Richard Lent\u2014who also own the Kimber Modern boutique hotel in South Austin\u2014became co-owners of Kasita in early 2019.\nRELATED\nThis smart tiny prefab could be an answer to affordable housing\nHome of the Future\nTiny homes get more versatile, affordable with Austin company\u2019s new modular line\nKasita just nabbed a place to manufacture its prefab tiny homes\nTiny houses, smart cars get together at SXSW\nTiny prefab home company Kasita moves beyond Austin\nRather than continuing to operate the company as a (very specialized) home builder that sells primarily individual residential dwellings (which it no longer does), Tomlin and Lent reinvented Kasita as a hospitality-oriented company. Individual Kasitas are now hotel suites, intended to be grouped and operated as a sort of hotel compound, with guests staying in individual, detached units rather than a single building. Guests will use various technologies come and go independent of any staff\u2014not unlike the intended independent, tech-based experience at the newly opened Arrive East Austin\u2014although there will be common areas available to guests as well.\nRELATED\nThis prefab apartment moves with you\n5 cool prefab homes you can order right now\n5 most impressive prefab homes from 2017\nAccording to its website, Kasita will launch its flagship site in Austin, where it has already signed a design, development, and management agreement for a property. It\u2019s scheduled to open in 2020. The website also indicates that the company intends to expand to San Antonio, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Portland, Oregon; Bentonville, Arkansas; and San Diego, California and invites parties interested in developing the hotels in other parts of the country to get in touch.\nTerms of Use Privacy Notice Cookie Policy Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Info Licensing FAQ Accessibility Platform Status\nContact Send Us a Tip Community Guidelines Masthead About Curbed Editorial Ethics and Guidelines\nVox Media Vox Media logo.\nAdvertise with us\nJobs @ Vox Media\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Before we have a look at the interior photos, here\u2019s the floor plan that shows how the unit is laid out.\nEntering the unit, there\u2019s a small hallway, and off to the right of the hallway is the bathroom, fully equipped with a shower, toilet and vanity.\nJust outside the bathroom is a storage closet with built-in shelves.\nThe kitchen is located next to the closet, and it has a small induction cooktop and a convection microwave oven, as well as more storage and two counter spaces.\nThe second counter space doubles as a desk/small work area and below the counter are fridge and freezer drawers.\nAt the end of the kitchen counter, you can see the washer / dryer, and the wooden stairs that lead down to the living area have hidden pull-out storage drawers.\nNext up is the living room that has a ceiling height of just over 10 feet. A custom designed couch fits the space perfectly and hides a bed.\nThe couch can be transformed into a queen-size bed by simply extending it out. Part of the couch frame now becomes bedside tables.\nAt the end of the unit is a raised platform that\u2019s surrounded by floor to ceiling windows, allowing plenty of light to fill the small space. A flat-screen television is hidden within the white storage cube with drawers, that also has a small bench next to it.\nemail newsletter signup:\nsubmit a project \u2022 newsletter signup \u2022 search \u2022 about \u2022 advertise \u2022 privacy policy \u2022 pinterest \u2022 facebook \u2022 twitter \u2022 tumblr \u2022 rss",

Well, now there is a company that will do just that.\nThe company is called Kasita (meaning \u2018little home\u2019) and it promises to deliver micro-homes at affordable prices.  Next stop, Austin, Texas!\nThe concept is the dream-child of Dr. Jeff Wilson, who is an environmental studies professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas.\nThe modules are steel and measure 10\u00d720 feet.  It\u2019s made for downtown and it offers everything you would find in a larger home such as washer/dryer, toilets, showers and even a sound system in the floor.  White walls, reflective surfaces and higher ceilings will give your brain the sense that you are living in a much larger space.\nThe front wall is made of enclosed glass which gives you a larger view of the world just outside.  Jeff Wilson, project director calls this the \u201cpersonal expression space\u201d.  No desks or furniture,  just a glass space.\nJeff\u2019s dream is that these modules will be part of a vast, global network of micro-homes located throughout the cities of the world.  The idea is not to rent spaces, but rather have your own space that you can take with you.  He envisions racks of up to 9 modules in one place.  A place where you can plug-in your home.   Hook up water, sewage, etc.   And if you want to move to another city, you move your module to another rack located in another city.\nIt all started with one professors school project and dream called the Dumpster Project.\nThe concept began when Professor Dumpster, i.e. Jeff Wilson, PHD embarked on a year long experiment; yes, to live in a dumpster. He turned a 33 square foot dumpster into a not-so conventional living space.\nThe Dumpster Project on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University\nAt first, his students laughed at the notion.  Jeff writes, \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home.\u201d  He tested the limits of what is needed as the smallest living space possible. The dumpster still sits on campus as a reminder of the project and as an educational tool for students, artists and educators.\nJeff learned a few things while living in such a small space for a  year. Lower rent, lower utility payments, less time spent doing chores, a shorter commute to work (his Dumpster was on campus) and less money spent on unnecessary possessions. More importantly, Jeff took his idea to create a company all about small and compact living space.\n\u201cThe Dumpster Projected aimed to create the most high-tech, sustainable micro living space in the World.\u201d Jeff says, \u201cthere are a lot of possibilities. We could end up with a house under $10,000 that can be placed anywhere in the world with sunlight and surface water. People could have a pretty good life. We could also end up with the ultimate, West Texas hunting blind.\u201d\nJeff began to realize that conceptually, a small space like a dumpster could move anywhere; rent was low; commutes were short; and the local neighborhood became an intimate living room.\n\u201cAs the experiment drew to a close, Wilson took what he\u2019d learned and returned to the drawing board where Kasita came to life, a new category of home that married iconic design and pioneering technology with insights gleaned from a trashcan.\u201d (Kasita Website)\nThe concept is quite exciting and captures the \u2018futuristic\u2019 side of all of us.

Now, Kasita continues to improve the homes and extend its outreach.\nWilson, co-founder of Kasita, recognized the potential for smaller homes after living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year. While teaching at Huston-Tillotson University, Wilson sold his possessions and moved into a campus dumpster in early February 2014.\n\n\u201cIt was a grand experiment in testing the question of, \u2018How much do you really need to be happy?\u2019\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI wanted to take something that was both very small and also a symbol of waste, which happened to be a dumpster.\u201d\nThe business launched in April 2015, three months following Wilson\u2019s departure from his dumpster. Today, Kasita has 27 employees divided among the technology and production teams. According to Kasita\u2019s website, the building process for a single home takes at least seven weeks, with prices starting at $150,000.\nWilson said Kasitas are unique because they are built as an immersive experience rather than a home.\n\u201cKasita\u2019s the only micro-home out there and one of the only homes in the world where it has technology integrated in it from the very beginning,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou walk in the door, and everything just works.\u201d\nWhile this wave of micro-living spans across the country, some disagree with its functionality, such as architectural engineering professor Atila Novoselac. He said when factoring in air quality, smaller spaces are problematic because energy emissions from appliances have a larger impact in smaller houses than larger houses.\n\u201cYou\u2019re solving some problems about living space but also turning a new set of problems, which are solvable,\u201d Novoselac said. \u201cBut it generates a completely new perspective of how you should design those houses.\u201d\nThough Novoselac opposes the micro-home movement, he said tiny houses are necessary for limited spaces like crammed cities. Luckily, Wilson said Kasitas are specifically built for slivers of land.\n\u201cI really wanted to find a place in the cracks to put housing,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cKasita\u2019s really great because we can put it on very small pieces of land where most people aren\u2019t looking to put things.\u201d\nEven students find micro-homes desirable and recognize their potential, including Terrell Brown, an architecture and architectural engineering junior.\n\u201cJust thinking of the possibilities of what (micro-homes) could be used for, it was really eye-opening for me,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI feel like it could potentially be the future of architectural style.\u201d\nThis idea of micro-homes does not stop there \u2014 Kasita now has 10 houses nationally and aims to build 80 more within the next year. The business hopes to extend its outreach beyond California, Nevada and Texas, and eventually expand internationally.\nWilson said Kasita plans to add more electronic features, move toward an artificially intelligent home and continue to make micro-living easier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about building a small home,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe\u2019re building out a larger network to where one day \u2014 say five years from now \u2014 when you leave UT, you can be living in a Kasita right off the UT campus.\u201d\nLike This Story\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X\nEmail this Story\nPrint this Story\nMore in Life and Arts\nAustin\u2019s historic Paramount Theatre celebrates 50 years of classic films\nUpcoming bar crawl offers expansion of 6th Street-style nightlife in West Campus, provides student artists a stage\nFive local boutiques to shop Longhorn paraphernalia, prepare for game day\nSabrina Carpenter\u2019s Short n\u2019 Sweet tastes a little bland\nUT medical student one step closer to physician, honors mother\u2019s story with Dell Med white coat ceremony\nQ&A: Alum discusses screenwriting, how UT prepared her to change the world with stories like \u2018Moana\u2019\nMore in Uncategorized\nDowntown safety team to expand in coming months amid APD shortage\nDT 07/16/2024\nDT 07/09/2024\nNew Austin State Hospital opens in partnership with Dell Medical School\nDT 4/12/2024\nTravis Scott y Michael Rubin hablan de fracaso y esp\u00edritu empresarial en el Auditorio Hogg\nThe Daily Texan\nOfficial newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin\nAdvertise\nNewsletters\nContact\nTexas Student Media\nFacebook\nInstagram\nX\nSpotify\nYouTube\nFlickr\nRSS Feed\n\u00a9 2024 All images and content The Daily Texan \u2022 FLEX Pro WordPress Theme by SNO \u2022 Log in\n\u00d7",

Taylor Wilson, son of veteran Austin area homebuilder Clark Wilson, is partnering with Wilson in the new company. Jeff Wilson and Taylor Wilson are not related.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home,\u201d Jeff Wilson has said of the concept.\nThe tiny units will be about 200 square feet, with 10-foot ceilings and can be relocated to other sites in other cities, Kasita\u2019s founders say.\n\u201cThrough partnerships with local entities, Kasita will be able to provide attainable housing at $600 a month once manufacturing is at scale,\u201d Taylor Wilson said. That\u2019s about half the amount a studio apartment near downtown currently rents for, he said.\nThe micro units will be aimed at urban Millennials, as well as other professionals and singles who want to live near city centers. Units could also be used for student housing and other populations, Kasita executives said.\n\u201cWith Kasita, we\u2019re able to bring higher utility to smaller tracts of land in highly desirable areas, at more attainable prices,\u201d Taylor Wilson said.\nThe first prototype, with nine units, is being designed and manufactured at W2 MacFab, a company in East Austin, Taylor Wilson said.\nKasita\u2019s founders say the units will \u201cfeel spacious and full of light\u201d equipped with traditional amenities such as a queen size bed, walk-in shower, refrigerator, convection oven and cooktop, dishwasher and laundry machines.\nEach Kasita unit will plug into traditional utilities.\nKasita was announced at the South by Southwest Eco conference this week.\nThe Kasitas will be available in Austin beginning in 2016 and in potentially ten other cities starting in 2017. Future Kasita homes could include Portland, Los Angeles, Brooklyn and Stockholm, Sweden.\nIn Austin, the first Kasita prototypes are slated for two as yet undisclosed sites, one near downtown and the other in East Austin, Taylor Wilson said.\nIn March, Taylor Wilson had announced plans for another \u201cmicro unit\u201d project, to be known as Spire and planned for East Austin. Wilson said he still plans to move forward with that project, but is still trying to nail down a site after the initial one did not work out.\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nAd\nLearn More\nYour premier men\u2019s tele-health clinic\nUnlock better performance with a quick 3-min survey\nOfNoah\n|\nAd\nDo This Everyday to Ease Eczema Flare-Ups\nScientifically proven relief: Drink this daily to halt eczema flare-ups.

Dr. Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, drew upon this experience to co-create Kasita: a modern and smart urban micro-home. Geared toward professional types, it can be moved to another location with relative ease.\nStill in the planning and prototype stage, Kasita brings to mind elements of the tiny house and shipping container home communities. It comprises just 208 sq ft (19 sq ft) of floorspace, including a bathroom, a kitchenette, study, and a lounge. A cantilevering glass front section is a nice touch.\nMORE STORIES\nARCHITECTURE\nWasp-inspired setup 3D-prints complete homes for $1,000\nTINY HOUSES\nEasy-to-tow tiny house doubles down on space-saving design\nAvailable amenities include a walk-in shower, refrigerator, convection oven and cooktop, washer/dryer, and a queen-size bed that can be tucked away. The interior sports modular tiles that can be outfitted with shelving, gadgets, and furniture.\nThe home is smart too. \"Your Kasita will welcome you home by adjusting the A/C, bringing up the lights and shades, and queueing your favorite playlist,\" says the firm's blurb. \"Or, ask your Kasita to do something else (like rolling out the bed) via hands-free voice commands throughout.\"\nThe amenities promised are pretty generous, and include a walk-in shower, refrigerator, convection oven and cooktop, washer/dryer, and a queen-size bedKasita\nEach Kasita is a self-contained unit that slots into a larger \"rack,\" which provides the necessary plumbing and electricity. This modular system means that if you want to move, your home can follow. For example, if you live in San Francisco and want to move to Austin, you could access an app on your phone and request a move, the company would then take care of the rest (the rest involves removing the home from its rack before transporting it via truck to another rack with a vacant space).\nWhile certainly ambitious, a plan is afoot to bring Kasita to market and the firm aims to build several units in Austin sometime in 2016. Additional units are also planned for 10 other cities the following year. The cost to buy hasn't been revealed, but rent in Austin is expected to cost around US$600 per month. This seems cheap, but Kasita says it has an innovative business model that makes it doable. Future plans also include a student housing model.\nSource: Kasita\nVIEW GALLERY - 7 IMAGES\nTAGS\nTINY HOUSESBUILDING AND CONSTRUCTIONSMART HOMECONCEPT ARCHITECTURETINY FOOTPRINT\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFlipboard\nLinkedIn\n2 COMMENTS\nAdam Williams\nAdam scours the globe from his home in Spain in order to bring the best of innovative architecture and sustainable design to the pages of New Atlas.

Despite the small space, Jeff found big inspiration that prompted him to create the future of minimal living.\n\nIn 2015, he started Kasita; an Austin-based company that builds prefabricated homes that have the option to be stacked to create an apartment building. Each home will be sold for $139,000 and has just 352 sq ft of space but there's already a waiting list! A fee of $1,000 gets you onto the list and the first of the homes begin shipping out to customers in June.\n\nEach home has a kitchen, sleeping space, storage, a bathroom, and a small raised living room. Large windows on one end of the home help to make the home feel bigger than it is.\n\nBe sure to check out a video tour of the home below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKasita - One Size.

Stream all episodes, only on DisneyPlusSG now.\nAD DISNEYPLUS SG\nSIGN UP\nDESIGN/TECH/SMART HOME\nThis tiny modular home is 325 square feet of IoT heaven\nBy The Verge\nSep 6, 2017, 9:00 PM GMT+8\nShare this story\n0 Comments0 New\nWelcome to Home of the Future, a four-part video series co-produced by Curbed and The Verge. Each month, we'll take you inside one innovative home and explore how the technology of today informs the way people will live in the future. To follow along, stay tuned for new video episodes on our Facebook page. This month\u2019s location? A tiny prefab billed as the \u201ciPhone for housing.\u201d\nTiny houses have long been a dwelling of choice for those who appreciate a minimalist lifestyle, but they\u2019ve become even more trendy in recent years after an ongoing affordable housing crisis (and, admittedly, HGTV\u2019s House Hunters spinoff on the miniature homes). But tiny doesn\u2019t have to mean it\u2019s missing out on any special features of a futuristic home either. Kasita, an Austin-based startup, is hoping to fit all the latest tech into just 352 square feet of living space. In fact, the company calls its micro-homes the \u201ciPhone for housing.\u201d\nKasita is outfitted with the latest voice-activated tech, so you can program your home to recognize \u201cmoods.\u201d Tell Kasita to prepare for theater mode and it\u2019ll know to dim the lights, raise the flatscreen TV out from a hidden wall, and open your favorite streaming app. The model unit Kasita founder Jeff Wilson showed us has more than 60 smart home devices that are preprogrammed to talk to each other, and span areas including home security, indoor temperature, and even the shower room to help save water consumption. Wilson says to buy these devices separately, it would cost over $20,000, plus the amount of time it takes to connect the devices together under one system. Kasita\u2019s turnkey micro-unit costs $139,000 with everything ready to go and controllable from the main Kasita app.\nThe home isn\u2019t just designed for those looking to live on remote land or strap the unit to their van and move around the country either. In dense, urban areas like Houston and Brooklyn, Kasita units can be stacked to create a tower of micro-apartments, or used as commercial space for tiny restaurants and shops.\nThe company is currently working with local governments to pilot Kasita communities as an affordable housing solution. Earlier this year, the company opened a 25,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in East Austin that can churn out a unit in just eight weeks.\n0 COMMENTS0 NEW\nFEATURED VIDEOS FROM THE VERGE\nHands-on with the Pixel 9 Pro\u2019s camera\nGoogle\u2019s new Pixel 9 Pro features a triple rear camera system with a 50-megapixel wide, a 48-megapixel 5x telephoto, and a 48-megapixel ultrawide. And this year it comes in two sizes\u2013 the 6.3\" Pixel Pro for $999 and 6.8\" Pixel Pro XL for $1,099. But it wouldn\u2019t be a new Pixel device without some new software tricks including text prompting AI features in Magic Editor and an Add Me feature that allows even the person taking the photo to be in it.\nNow Streaming\nFrom gritty action series to variety, stream these quality K-content only on Disney+ now\nAD DISNEYPLUS SG\nSIGN UP\nMost Popular\nMOST POPULAR\nMartin Shkreli must surrender his Wu-Tang album copies\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16 launch event is set for September\nNintendo is closing out the summer with a 40-minute showcase\nNo one\u2019s ready for this\nThis over-the-counter gadget could help the war against diabetes\nVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.\nEmail (required)\nSIGN UP\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

His name is Jeff Wilson - known around Austin as \"Professor Dumpster\" - and his new mission is to disrupt housing with a hi-tech, smart microhome company called Kasita.\n\nI joined Kasita as Director of Marketing and led a team to introduce Kasita to the world and redefine what the future of living could look like. We developed a brand strategy and, working in collaboration with our agency partner - Preacher - created a new brand identity. The brand then came to life through photo and video content, a new website, social content, and press outreach all activated to launch the new Kasita at SXSW 2017.\nBRANDING\nWhat if we approached housing like a product? This is the philosophy behind Kasita in its vision to design and mass-manufacturing a home like you would a car or any other product. So we followed that same approach in our brand strategy and set out to create the first global housing brand. The Nike, Apple, or Tesla of housing.

The reason he was holing up in such an unlikely structure wasn\u2019t merely for shock value (though that was part of it). He was trying to see how minimal a home could be while still achieving a high level of comfort and function. What he found was that 33 sq ft (the size of the dumpster) was too damn small. \u201cAt the end of the day, I was still peeing in a bottle,\u201d he told me. But he knew that with the right design, he could make something that was still very small, yet more capable than the his trash bin home. This conceit is informing his latest endeavor. Wilson and his partner Taylor Wilson (no relation) have founded Kasita, a prefabricated, modular housing system that is out to revolutionize compact urban architecture.\n\u201cThe biggest problem is affordability in urban cores in cities across the world, and housing is at the nexus of this problem,\u201d he told me. The lack of housing drives people to go the outskirts and suburbs of cities, where housing is larger and far more resource intensive. Wilson saw the need for something that could easily densify these urban cores, but nothing out there was cutting it from his perspective.\nIn devising a solution, Wilson bypassed the counsel of architects and sought out the \u201cbaddest ass product designer\u201d he could find. Because space efficiency was of the utmost importance, he wanted someone more accustomed to dealing in millimeters than 2\u201d x 4\u201d studs. That person turned out to be noted industrial designer Remy Labesque. The design Labesque created is a sleek, fully-furnished 208 sq ft unit. There\u2019s a small kitchen, seating area, storage and a bathroom. There\u2019s a unique tile system along one wall that can support a variety of plugin accessories ranging from a bike hook to speakers.\n\u201cThe bed was the real challenge,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cMost of the tiny housing bed solutions just didn\u2019t seem that great to me. For example, tiny houses usually have low-ceilinged loft beds, which aren\u2019t ideal if you like to drink, make love or do both at the same time.\u201d Because they made their ceilings ten feet high, they were able to use a volume underneath the kitchen for an easily-accessed trundle bed without compromising the overall spaciousness of the unit. \nPerhaps the most innovative aspect of the Kasita is its frame that the units are plugged into. The frame is centrally connected to the municipal grid (sewers, water, gas and electric) and utilities are then distributed to the units through the frame\u2019s infrastructure. This makes for quick and cheap set up and construction. This speed will make Kasita ideal for installation in empty or underutilized urban lots. Wilson told me that a nine unit frame can fit onto as little as 1K sq ft; even accounting for requisite setbacks, this is a small footprint. He also said they\u2019re ideal for \u201cflag properties\u201d\u2013odd shaped parcels of land that are tough to fill with conventional structures.\nThe prefabricated construction, small size and ease of setup result in lower costs. Wilson projects that once production is up to speed, Kasita units will rent at 50% of normal market rates for comparable studios, which in Austin is $600.\nOftentimes when I see awesome renderings such as Kasita\u2019s, I think of the V word (\u201cvaporware\u201d\u2013something that looks and seems cool but has almost no chance of being built). Wilson assured me that Kasita is not that. The first prototype unit is expected to be complete in three weeks and a 2 x 2 frame will be complete a week later. They have already purchased land in Austin to build the first 3 x 3 Kasita building. Most crucially, they have been working with Austin Planning and Zoning Department as well as the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation to ensure that Kasita is code compliant. They have already received a round of seed funding and will be raising their Series A later this year. He expects to have the first Kasita building built by the end of 2016. We wish them godspeed and look forward to seeing these built.\nMicro Prefab KASITA Goes Live\nThe Problem(s) with Tiny Houses\nAre Micro-Units Helping or Hurting Our Cities?\nForget Dumpster Diving.

One Texan entrepreneur has an antidote.\nAustin-based start-up Kasita was founded by environmental science professor Dr Jeff Wilson, following the year he spent living in a spruced, solar-powered dumpster as part of an experiment. Now his digs are decidedly more impressive: Kasita has created stackable and completely mobile living spaces of a modest 32.7 square metres.\nA post shared by Kasita (@kasita) on Mar 23, 2017 at 2:26pm PDT\nRe-imagining the home as a functional space, the Kasita prototypes are self-dubbed \u2018the iPhone for housing\u2019 and considering each home can be controlled completely via smartphone app, it\u2019s not far from the truth. With a connected app, residents can monitor the temperature, lighting, integrated sound system, as well as transparency of the glass walls of one corner for privacy. There\u2019s also an energy recovery ventilation system, and water and energy is perfectly trackable for maximum efficiency. The kicker though? It can be popped on an 18-wheeler and moved to wherever your heart (and your permit) desires. The team at Kasita has even conceived of kind-of carparks where your Kasita can live for a few months, then slot into another carpark somewhere else, making for super-modern mobility.\n\u201cThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, the permitting and the land,\u201d Jeff says of the project. \u201cAnd the land\u2019s the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks who need affordable housing. So, our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetise that land, while providing home ownership to someone.\u201d\nA post shared by Kasita (@kasita) on May 10, 2017 at 2:04pm PDT\nA post shared by Kasita (@kasita) on Apr 9, 2017 at 9:42am PDT\nPointing out that the housing model hasn\u2019t had much of an update since 1884, when the first US skyscraper was built, Kasita aims to reimagine the urban landscape and allow more affordable and adaptable housing opportunities. Price is a big consideration, with models beginning at US$139,000.

(Kasita)\nThis article appeared in the summer issue of Urban Land on page 66.\nThe origin story for micro-housing builder Kasita is part of modular home lore. To make a point, founder Jeff Wilson in 2014 spent a year living in a Dumpster. A dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Wilson regarded his time in the customized trash receptacle as an experiment, a teaching exercise, and ultimately a research project on tiny-home design. He stepped out of the container with a clear vision of what is important in living space.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re living in a 33-square-foot [3 sq m] space for a year, everything comes into sharp focus,\u201d Wilson says today.\nWilson believes that focus has led him to the solution to the riddle of making modular housing a viable commercial option. The Austin-based Kasita is mass manufacturing carefully designed, fully equipped modular homes that can be easily transported and made ready for habitation almost as soon as they arrive on site. The typical model has 352 square feet (33 sq m) of space and includes a bathroom, a kitchen, a washer/dryer, a living area with a slide-out queen-sized bed, integrated Alexa-like technology, and a glass cube on the end that can be used as a seating area.\nKasita\u2019s strategy is to make the micro-homes capable of mass manufacturing and as close to plug-and-play as possible to appeal to developers. While it is still marketing its product to consumers\u2014the traditional prefab market of granny flats and quick-and-easy rural homes\u2014Kasita is pitching the easily stackable, industrial-designed units, built to International Building Code or International Residential standards, as a better way of creating infill projects.\n\u201cHaving the full package is different than anything out there,\u201d Wilson says.\nSitting in the Dumpster, Wilson had an epiphany, he says. Looking up at the stars one night, he asked, Why don\u2019t we stop making houses the way we make houses and make them the way we make everything else in the world?\nWilson decided to throw away conventional designs for modular homes and start from scratch, examining every element of a house. Instead of hiring an architect, he hired a product designer to create something focused on end-users.\nHigh ceilings and full-wall windows give a feeling of spaciousness. (Kasita)\nKasita\u2019s ambition may sound familiar. Developers, entrepreneurs, and designers have been working with prefab and modular designs for decades. Today, companies around the world are developing new forms of tiny homes, from revamped shipping containers to fold-up residences.\nThe results have been mixed, at best. Startup after startup has made dramatic proclamations about changing the housing paradigm, generating investor capital and volumes of positive magazine features, only to disappear amid construction issues and a lack of market interest.\nTraditionally, the expectations for prefab housing have far exceeded the reality, says Allison Arieff, former editor of Dwell, who wrote the 2002 book Prefab about innovations in the industry. Prefab can be helpful in addressing housing issues, she says, but the prevailing issues of new housing\u2014land prices, construction costs, and NIMBYism (not in my backyard)\u2014will not be solved by prefab homes.\nFor a prefab design to succeed, \u201cit needs to work at scale,\u201d says Arieff, now editorial director of the San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association (SPUR).\nIn many ways, basic conflicts exist in the prefab business model. Mass production allows a company to scale the business, but makes it more difficult to achieve precise standards, analysts note. Buyers want choices, but offering them options ultimately undermines the value proposition of efficient manufacturing techniques.\n\u201cCustomization is a huge issue,\u201d Arieff says. \u201cTo provide tenants with options, you\u2019re slowly removing the assembly-line stuff that makes it possible.\u201d\nA rendering of Kasita units stacked to create a multifamily building. (Kasita)\nFor many developers, the efficiencies and cost savings of prefab housing tend to disappear on site during the construction phase. Units might not fit together precisely, the interiors still need work, and complicated work-arounds may be necessary to solve mechanical, engineering, and plumbing issues. Permitting can be a challenge, with each jurisdiction requiring specific nuances. Labor unions often see modular construction as a threat, creating another obstacle for builders.\n\u201cIt never comes out that construction costs are less [with prefab],\u201d says Courtney McRickard, a partner in Denver-based 063 Design & Development, which is using Kasita modules to develop a 24-unit project in the Berkeley suburb of Denver.\n\u201cWhat makes [modular construction] appealing is the speed to market,\u201d McRickard says. She predicts that the Kasita project will require 30 to 40 percent less time to build once construction starts. \u201cThe benefit is the project goes faster.\u201d\nBut construction is only part of the process, McRickard says. \u201cThe biggest challenge is making sure all the coordination has been thought out,\u201d she says. \u201cWe spent six to seven months talking it through before we put anything on paper.\u201d\nKasita\u2019s appeal is that it is \u201calmost turnkey modular,\u201d McRickard says. Buyers will be able to \u201cshow up with a toothbrush\u201d and move in, she says. The design and integrated technology will also appeal to the market, the developer believes. \u201cThe automation speaks to the lifestyle people want.\u201d\nThe Denver project, Kasita\u2019s first with a developer, calls for retail space on the ground floor, built using traditional methods, with two levels of stacked Kasita modules on top and a rooftop deck above. Units are expected to sell for about $400,000, which will be affordable compared with the $650,000 typically paid for homes in the area, McRickard says.\nSince its launch in 2015, Kasita has gone through its own learning process. Early versions were designed to be mobile and easily inserted into a vertical frame, like a giant wine rack. People could move their home to another city and simply slide it into the grid. But that idea was soon jettisoned. \u201cCodes and physics\u201d made the frame concept difficult, and it turned out there was little enthusiasm for \u201chauling around a big box,\u201d Wilson says.\nKasita executives say they are keenly aware of the problems and failures of past attempts at modular design. \u201cWe\u2019re learning from those who have gone before us,\u201d says chief operating officer Benji Miller, whose background is in aerospace engineering and supply-chain logistics.\nProviding a comfortable couch that is easy to slide out as a bed was one of the toughest design challenges. (Kasita)\nEarly on, the designers established a long list of criteria for Kasita units, including the need to be easily shippable and work in different climates. A key challenge was to design a \u201crepeatable product\u201d that could be manufactured and meet construction standards, regardless of the location, Miller says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important to have high-precision methods so there is no question of how it comes together when it is on the site,\u201d Miller says.\nThe ground-up design prompted discussion about every aspect of the modular business, including construction, materials, and the way people want to live in their homes. \u201cRather than starting with a bunch of parts and trying to fit them together, we started with the idea and then figured out how to make it,\u201d Wilson says.\nThe realities of the criteria quickly influenced key variables. The width of the 352-square-foot (33 sq m) unit\u201411 feet, nine inches (3 m, 58 cm)\u2014was dictated by the maximum width of a home that could be transported on roads without escorts. The interior height started out at eight feet, six inches (2 m, 59 cm)\u2014roughly the height of a shipping container\u2014but grew to ten feet, two inches (3 m, 10 cm) when the company realized the home could be transported by a \u201clowboy\u201d trailer.\nSomewhere along the line, Wilson realized that any design must be tempered by the reality of the market. Consumers want spaces that feel and function like traditional homes, and developers do not want surprises, he learned.\n\u201cWe needed to make it innovative enough to be interesting, but similar enough to developers to make it real and doable,\u201d Wilson says.\nEvery aspect of the interior became a challenge. Even a minor change would send ripples through the design of the entire space. Lights and cooling systems were tested for energy conservation and ease of installation. Routing for pipes and cable had to be carefully aligned. \u201cThere are only so many ways you can arrange it, and I think we tried all of them,\u201d says Kasita principal architect Dason Whitsett. \u201cWe were trying to be as efficient and optimized as we can get.\u201d\nFocus groups were asked to respond to the design and people were enlisted to live in early prototypes to provide direct feedback on how they experienced the space. The goal, says Whitsett, was determining how to let residents \u201clive a normal life and not feel compromised.\u201d\nWhile residents like to customize their space, standardization is key to efficient production. (Kasita)\nThe bed turned out to be the biggest design issue. \u201cWe spent a tremendous amount of time working on the bed,\u201d Whitsett says. There were many iterations as the designers looked for a design that would make it easy for anyone to slide the bed out from under the couch, without any grunting and groaning, while still providing a regular, comfortable bed (and couch). No one wanted an old-style Murphy bed or a typical hideaway sleeper sofa.\n\u201cLet me give you a tour,\u201d Miller said, as he showed visitors through a Kasita prototype on exhibit during the ULI Spring Meeting in Detroit. The house has only 352 square feet (32.7 sq m) of space but offers nooks and crannies. A hallway leads past the bathroom with a shower stall and a narrow kitchen that looks like a smaller version of one that might be found in many small apartments. Three stairs lead down to the living area, with the couch on one side and a bench on the other, in front of the glass cube.\n\u201cThe feature I really love is the conversation pit,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cIt\u2019s a throwback to the seventies.\u201d\nThe queen-sized bed easily slides out from the couch assembly; it is designed to open with only eight pounds of pressure. Even when the bed is open, people can still move around the living area. Storage space is tucked under the stairs and the bench. Tall windows and the cantilevered glass cube help fill the home with natural light.\n\u201cThe biggest thing is the sense of space,\u201d Whitsett says. \u201cWe worked hard to bring in a lot of daylight.\u201d\nThe Kasita designers wanted to \u201chumanize\u201d micro-housing\u2014to focus on the priorities and interests of the people who will live in the home, Whitsett says. To that end, the shower was given more space. The use of toxin-free materials and the integrated technology were considered core elements of the design. The floors are Marmoleum, a natural, toxic chemical\u2013free form of linoleum. The integrated technology accepts voice commands to play music, as well as adjust lighting and window coverings, which helps cut energy use. Top-end units include installed speakers in the living room and bathroom, home monitoring, and ceiling fans with sensors that automatically respond to heat, humidity, and movement.\nMaximizing energy efficiency was \u201ca big part of the discussion\u201d with Kasita designers, says Dan Nelson, senior director of Big Ass Fans, which supplies the ceiling fans. \u201cThey seem to know who they are and what they are trying to accomplish.\u201d\nBuyers will have other options, such as choices of cabinets and electronics, and developers will be able to choose the exterior cladding, but the number of selections has been purposely limited. \u201cCustomers like to feel like they are choosing design details, but it doesn\u2019t drive efficiency,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWhat you see is what you get with Kasita.\u201d\nThe product design approach\u2014combining a focus on the user and the realities of manufacturing\u2014helps make the end product different from traditional modular concepts, company executives say. \u201cOften architects have a myopic view focusing on design as a solution,\u201d Whitsett says. \u201c[Design] is important, but it\u2019s not the only thing.\u201d\nBy creating a product that can be mass manufactured, Kasita hopes to provide an option for affordable housing, an issue plaguing cities around the world. Prices for Kasita homes range from $89,000 for a base unit with no appliances or technology to $129,000 for a fully equipped model with hardwood floors, premium appliances, and the full tech suite. Kasita\u2019s promotional materials note that modules also can be used for hospitality, mixed-use space, and student housing, with four or five stories an ideal height for a Kasita-based project.\n\u201cThis is where construction is going,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWe take a lot of the risk out of the process.\u201d\nKasita is facing a range of competitors, with housing and design firms racing to present affordable, scalable options. Two examples are Pittsburgh-based Module, which is building concept homes for private buyers, and Seattle-based Blokable, which is targeting the need for dwellings for formerly homeless people. (Both were profiled in \u201cMaking Housing Attainable\u201d in the Spring 2018 issue of Urban Land.)\nKasita has raised more than $13 million in early financing, including support from Gary Keller, founder of the Keller Williams real estate firm. Earlier this year, Arthur Gensler, founder of the Gensler architecture and design firm, joined the company\u2019s advisory board.\nKasita has the capacity to produce 100 units a year in its Austin factory, but expects to ramp up to 300 to 500 a year in 2019 using regional locations, Miller says. The company has reported interest from developers in Houston and New York City, but the Denver project likely will be the first to market.\nWilson recognizes that any prefab product must overcome a variety of obstacles, including market skepticism. But he believes Kasita has already solved the biggest problem. \u201cWe figured out what is important to people,\u201d he says.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nPrint\nCopy\nEmail\nPublic\nKevin Brass\nKEVIN BRASS writes regularly about property and development for the New York Times International Edition and the Financial Times.\nMOST RECENT\nULI LEADERSHIP // PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS\nLeading Nevada to a Sustainable Future\nDEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION // RETAIL\nIn Brief: 25 Chain Retailers Expanding Across North America\nDEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION // INFRASTRUCTURE \u2013 TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSIT\nLas Vegas Betting on Bus Rapid Transit to Spur Development Along Key Corridors\nISSUES AND TRENDS // LEADERSHIP\nUL Interview: Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman\nISSUES AND TRENDS // AFFORDABLE HOUSING\nThe Hidden Logic of India\u2019s Housing Called \u201cSlums\u201d\nRELATED CONTENT\nULI LEADERSHIP\nFormer Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett Appointed ULI Fellow to Steer Urban Development and Downtown Revitalization Efforts\nAugust 19, 2024\nRESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY // MULTIFAMILY\nAfter Surfside: New Regulations and Skyrocketing Insurance Premiums Strain Condo Owners\nAugust 16, 2024\n \u2022 \nHannah Miet\nRESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY // DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION\n10 Questions for Investors to Ask Climate-Risk Analytic Providers\nAugust 14, 2024\n \u2022 \nJuan Pablo Quintero\nDEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION // RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY\nDenver: A Renaissance on the South Platte Riverfront\nAugust 13, 2024\n \u2022 \nLaura Newman\nLoad More\nE-NEWSLETTER\nThis Week in Urban Land\nSign up to get UL articles delivered to your inbox weekly.\nEmail address\nSubmit\nThe mission of the Urban Land Institute: Shape the future of the built environment for transformative impact in communities worldwide\nExplore Urban Land Magazine\nTopics\nProperty Types\nMarkets\nAbout Urban Land\nCurrent Issue\nArchives\nAdvertisers\nAdvertise With Urban Land\nSponsored Posts\nULI Corporate Partner Program\nEditorial Calendar\nULI Marketplace\nAbout ULI\nULI Events\nULI Mission Priorities\nContact Us\nLegal Notices\nGet Updates\nJoin ULI\n\u00a92024 Urban Land Institute.

Add an iPhone to the tiny house movement, and you get Kasita, a very smart, modular, and ultra-compact home dubbed the \"iPhone of housing.\"\nTiny living has taken center stage in recent years due to a variety of factors ranging from the rising costs of living, heightened awareness of environmental issues, and the desire to lead a more mobile life. Tiny houses and alternative housing options also make for great Instagram content, which turned tiny living itself into a bankable occupation.\n\nBefore all this, there was the Kasita. Like the Boxabl Casita, a viral star since word got out that Tesla CEO Elon Musk lived in a prototype outside of SpaceX in Texas, the name comes from the Spanish word meaning \"little house.\"\n\nThe Kasita idea goes back to 2014 when creator Jeff Wilson was living out of a dumpster and started thinking about a unit that would be ideal for densely populated urban areas.\n\nPhoto: Kasita\nWilson is a former environmental studies professor at Huston-Tillotson University, who also goes by Professor Dumpster because of that project that saw him live out of a repurposed dumpster for a year. He then moved on to the Kasita, which he unveiled in 2015, and, even later, the Jupe glamping unit, which uses some of the modularity features from Kasita to create the perfect vacation accommodation wherever you might be.\n\nKasita looks like a container house and features a layout similar to what you might find in one of those. The difference is that it's not made out of a container but of prefabricated aluminum composite panels assembled on-site over a steel structural framework.\n\nOne such micro-dwelling is perfect as a permanent residence for two people, or it could be joined with other units to create larger, multiple-bedroom family homes. Stack more such units, and you get \"instant\" (-ish) homes for crowded urban areas where construction permits are impossible to get.\n\nPhoto: Kasita\nThe Kasita has a linear layout, with an elevated platform at one end hiding the electrics and offering extra storage. The platform holds the kitchen and dining area, the bathroom, and a utility closet, while the front end is taken up by the bedroom slash lounge and an atrium-like living.\n\nWilson unveiled a functional Kasita prototype with this layout in 2015. In between having it on display at various local trade events, he used it as his home. It was a welcome upgrade to living in a dumpster tiny home, to be sure: the Kasita prototype offered 319 square feet (30 square meters) of living space.\n\nLater that year, Wilson revealed plans for a series production unit that came with 352 square feet (33 square meters) of living space and took eight weeks to finish before the on-site assembly. It came equipped with the same IoT features as the prototype, so there'd be more than 60 connected gadgets and home devices meant to make life easier, more comfortable, and more convenient.\n\nPhoto: Kasita\nAside from being a very compact, quite elegant, and relatively mobile tiny house (*assuming you hired a crane and truck to move it around), Kasita immediately stood out for its smart features. This was a home that came with everything from smart lights and blinds, remote unlock, home security, and permanent monitoring of all functions, including water consumption.\n\nWilson's unit even had a feature that recognized moods based on his voice when uttering commands. Preset, more obvious modes like \"theater\" were also available, dimming the lights, bringing out the TV from its hideaway, and opening Netflix.\n\n\"Kasita is on a mission to solve the housing crisis in America with our seamlessly smart, beautifully designed light homes,\" the Kasita team said in 2015 when the time came to bring the units to mass production. \"We have taken a product design approach to housing in a way never before imagined.\"\n\nThe interior was equally modular, and it was part of the unique design approach. As photos in the gallery show, the open-plan interior allowed for multiple functionalities, from coffee shop to personal gym, office, or home. Wilson's unit was a home and was specced accordingly, including full-size appliances in the kitchen, a full bathroom, and elegant finishes.\n\nPhoto: Kasita\nThe living area was wrapped in self-tinting glass, helping to create a home environment that was both airy and brightly lit by the sun. When you're dealing with compact layouts designed to double as permanent residences, it's gimmicks like these that help with making them feel less cramped.\n\nAt the time, Kasita was presented as a one-for-all solution, with customers ranging from urban millennials looking to put their own spin on home ownership to retirees, environmentalists, middle-class workers, and the well-heeled looking to switch it up with a smart tiny.\n\nHowever, the base price of the Kasita was anything but affordable: $139,000 for a turnkey unit. This probably went a long way toward stalling the project, but Kasita lives on as a viable, if too costly, example of minimalist, smart, and mobile living.\n\nIf you liked the article, please follow us:   Google News Youtube Instagram\nUP NEXT    South Africa's Jetstream Brings a Unique Spin to the Timeless Teardrop and It's a Home Run\nKASITA TINY HOUSE MOBILE HOME SMART HOME TECHNOLOGY IOT BOXABL CASITA WEEKEND\nAbout the author: ELENA GORGAN\nElena has been writing for a living since 2006 and, as a journalist, she has put her double major in English and Spanish to good use.

The original modular homes?)\nFollowing his residency in a literal dump, Wilson started Kasita (casita means \u201ctiny house\u201d in Spanish), a designer of mobile, modular, manufactured homes that are stackable. The prefabricated homes can be constructed in three weeks \u2014 and could go a long way toward easing the affordable housing crunch that has bedeviled much of the country, according to Wilson.\nSXSW HIGH-TECH TINY HOME GOSE BIG!\nWith the help of former employees at Google, Elon Musk\u2019s SolarCity and Bell Helicopter, Wilson thinks he has a solution to provide homes and stackable apartments in unused pieces of land such as vacant parking lots. \u201cIf you file for a backyard unit, it can be approved in weeks,\u201d says Wilson, who predicts his home could hit the market this summer.\n\u201cWe need to find cracks in the system rather than take a sledgehammer to it,\u201d he says.\nIf the reaction of consumers at Kasita\u2019s recent party at SXSW is any indication, interest is high. Hundreds patiently waited in line to get a peek at the modular home, which features a bathroom shower, kitchen, bedroom and living room patio.\nA remote control allows dwellers to quickly change mood lighting and an entertainment system. Date mode finds Marvin Gaye\u2019s smooth voice filling the small living area. Storage space is built into steps, walls, and other nooks and crannies.\nNote: Long before the \u201ctiny home\u201d phenomenon the major manufactured home and modular home manufacturers were producing high quality constructed, superbly engineered and beautifully equipped park models built to a well-respected building code averaging just under 400 sq.ft. of living space. These sustainable park models will have a price at about one-half the cost of the tiny home featured in this article and will be easier to legally locate and relocate.\nPark model floor plans, construction specifications and selected 3D virtual tours from the Skyline Homes building facilities in San Jacinto, California, Leola, Pennsylvania and Ocala, Florida are featured here at Manufactured Homes.com Click- Discover Manufacturers\u2013 to review these small homes.\nFIND A MANUFACTURED HOME RETAILER NEAR YOU TODAY\nAustin Texas, High Tech Tiny Home, Jeff Wilson, SXSW Festival\nRECENT POSTS\nMHARR TAKES MAJOR STEP ON EXCLUSIONARY ZONING WITH ACTING HUD SECRETARY ADRIANNE TODMAN\nMANUFACTURED HOME OWNERS GET MORE RIGHTS UNDER NEW FLORIDA LAW\nMANUFACTURED HOMES ARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND SAFER THAN EVER: CAN THEY HELP SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS?\nFROM BOOKWORK TO BLUEPRINTS: STUDENTS REACT TO A MODERN MANUFACTURED HOME\nThe ultimate Manufactured and Modular Home Resource.

It\u2019s a housing solution in search of a problem.\nKasita\nBy Kriston Capps\n18 December 2015 at 04:52 GMT+8\nSave\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about Kasita, a micro-modern-modular apartment building coming up in the heart of Texas. The units are 208 square feet in size: teeny-tiny, but these days, less is more. Especially in Austin, where the population as a whole is booming but where families with children are leaving the urban core in droves. To help singles squeeze their lives into such small spaces, Kasita boasts tons of interior-design bells and whistles, from modular \u201ctile\u201d shelving to various networked-home features.\nAnd then there\u2019s Professor Dumpster, aka Jeff Wilson, the former dean of Huston-Tillotson University who once made his home in a 33-square-foot dumpster as a teaching exercise.

Typically, when someone is looking for a house, they are merely looking at what is available, not what is possible. We\u2019ve talked about the Tiny House Movement before, but as of yet, in Buffalo, we haven\u2019t seen anything become of it other than talk. A fairly small house is located at the corner of Bryant and Ashland. And developer Rocco Termini once talked about building a complex with tiny units, but that\u2019s about it.\nThere\u2019s one thing to be said for tiny house. There\u2019s another thing to be said for tiny houses that can be stacked into rack systems, which combine to form modular buildings. That\u2019s essentially what\u2019s possible with the Kasita home \u2013 a house that was dreamed up by professor Jeff Wilson who wanted to create the \u2018iPhone for housing\u2019. The owner of the unit could literally have his or her pad picked up and moved to another rack system in another city, something akin to \u201cvertical RV parks\u201d.\nStay Informed with Buffalo Rising\nEmail Address\nWhile this type of living might not be for everyone, there are plenty of people who would appreciate a more compact lifestyle, including transient young people, military personnel, environmentalists, people who travel for a living, people who want to live closer to work and who can\u2019t afford typically expensive urban living\u2026\nA total of 5000 hours of engineering went in completing the beta version. Kasita incorporates electrochromic glass panels that lighten and darken by use of an app, or according to the sun\u2019s position in the sky (it\u2019s dynamic glass). Altogether, the prototype Kasita is 208 square feet, with the potential for outdoor living space or common areas that people can share. The production version that Wilson is on the process of rolling out would be 320 square feet. Even at that size, the micro unit will be able to be transported by an 18-wheeler truck, according to Wilson.\n\u201cThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, the permitting and the land,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cAnd the land\u2019s the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks that need affordable housing. So our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetize that land while providing home ownership to someone.\u201d\nUltimately, one of the greatest Kasita benefits is that of home ownership. According to Wilson, someone who typically rents a one bedroom apartment would be able to purchase a Kasita unit (in a rack environment). The cost would obviously be higher if someone was to purchase property and \u201cinstall\u201d one of these. The other option would be for property owners to \u201cconstruct\u201d these as rentals. The plan is to assemble thousands of Kasinas, which would keep the price down.\n\u201cSo folks aren\u2019t going to be flying around all the time in their Kasitas, but in 5 years let\u2019s say you want to move your Kasita, we can pull you out of that rack, put you on an 18-wheeler truck and move you to another rack or put it in a backyard,\u201d explained Wilson. \u201cSo you\u2019re no longer bound to the land that you own your house on and we think that that\u2019s the way that the world is moving.\u201d\nThe Kasita is versatile. It can be placed high atop buildings, or it can occupy a small plot of land. As people start looking for less expensive places to live, they are not going to want to make too many sacrifices. The Kasita is nothing but upside for many people who want to live minimally, while still loving where they dwell.\n  dwell\nelectrochromic glass\nhousing\nJeff Wilson\nKasita\nmicro housing\ntiny house\ntiny houses\nqueenseyes\nWebsite\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nNewell Nussbaumer is 'queenseyes' - Eyes of the Queen City and Founder of Buffalo Rising.

The kitchen offers standard amenities such as a dishwasher, an induction cooktop and a convection oven, while the sleeping area is fitted with a queen-sized mattress.\nThe company is working to develop wall panels that will accommodate shelving, bike racks and storage.\n\"Kasita is designed for a variety of individuals at different places in their life,\" the company said. \"From college kids in need of student housing, to urban millennials, to those enjoying retirement \u2013 Kasita is the perfect home.\"\nThe company hopes to attract developers, who can purchase multiple units and stack them up to 10 stories high.\n\"Not only are Kasita homes for individuals, or the answer for the urban housing crisis, but Kasitas can also serve as rapid-reusable crisis housing, event housing or a space to have the grandparents closer to the kids,\" the company said. \"We're still dreaming up the ways they'll be used.\"\nThe company was founded by Jeff Wilson, a former environmental studies professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin. Wilson spent several years working for IBM in California in the last 1990s, during the dot-com boom.\nFor a year, from 2014 to 2015, Wilson lived in a modified trash dumpster in Austin, which led him to start Kasita. Called The Dumpster Project, the experiment was meant to explore sustainable practises and new ways of living.\n\"Small living led Wilson to reimagine what a comfortable home could be \u2013 especially in a growing city in need of affordable, urban housing,\" Kasita states on its website. \"He took all the best elements of dumpster life \u2013 more from less, beautiful design, and smart technology \u2013 and conceptualised a dream space.\"\nThe company intends to start taking orders from customers this year, according to its website. Pricing has not yet been released.\nThis animation demonstrates the concept behind Kasita's micro-home startup\nKasita is part of a growing tiny-house movement, which advocates living simply in small structures.\nOther micro dwellings include cabins designed by Harvard students for stressed-out city dwellers and a pair of wooden dwellings in a Japanese village. A San Francisco-based company recently unveiled a prefabricated tiny house that comes shipped to the site in flat-packed boxes.\nPhotography is by Andrea Calo.\nRead more: Texas Prefabricated buildings Austin Micro homes Architecture Connected home Residential architecture and interiors Internet of Things USA Kasita Modular architecture Houses Residential Slideshows\nSubscribe to our newsletters\nYour email address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare and comment\n4 comments\nMore\nArchitecture\nInteriors\nDesign\nTechnology\nRecommended stories\nEight houses in Hawaii that celebrate island views\nDezeen's top five houses of July 2024\nAdidas unveils \"first football super shoe\"\nHeatherwick Studio unveils plans for rippled-glass shopping centre in Seoul\nFoster + Partners unveils plan for rebuilding Antakya post-earthquake\nKapsimalis Architects converts wine cellar into cavernous summer house\nSaudi Arabia unveils World Cup 2034 stadium on The Line at Neom\nCookFox to convert former New York City prison into affordable housing\nLatest from Dezeen Showroom\nRoyal Twin coat stand by SoldiDesign\nAmsterdam tile collection by Realonda\nIn Out Office seating by Alfredo H\u00e4berli for Andreu World\nLe Ville Valmanara tiles by Casalgrande Padana\nILE modular system by Foster + Partners for Benchmark\nBolete Lounge Bio seating by Patricia Urquiola for Andreu World\nSamba dining chair by David Aguirre for Aguirre\nBilbao sofa by Tim Rundle for Morgan\nComments\nVisit our comments page | Read our comments policy\nTop architecture stories\nMost\npopular\nMost\nrecent\n1\nUniversity of Stuttgart uses self-shaping timber for garden show pavilions\n2\nTrace Architecture Office creates bookstore within historic academy\n3\nTen inventive contemporary houses in Austin\n4\nTen unusual Indian houses completed in the last two years\n5\nGiona Bierens de Haan Architectures refreshes Swiss mountain chalet\nPatrick Bradley Architects adapts ruins into house using shipping container\nModul 28 transforms fortified church in Transylvania into guesthouse\nKPF set to cut terraces into Foster + Partners' HSBC skyscraper\nEight compact studios embedded into residential gardens\nSubscribe\nSubscribe to\nour newsletters\nYour email address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOM unveils skyscraper with \"handmade surfaces\" in Guadalajara\nReflect Architecture modernises remote saltbox houses on Newfoundland seafront\nPopular\njobs\nFeatured\njobs\n1\nSenior BIM coordinator at Conran and Partners\n2\nPart 2 architectural assistant at Matt Architecture\n3\nAssistant/associate professor of landscape architecture at Harvard Graduate School of Design\n4\nPart 2 architectural assistants/Part 3 architects at Goldstein Heather Architecture\n5\nArchitect at Soda Studio\nDezeen's top five houses of April 2024\nTiny music festival stage by Love Hult\u00e9n caters to crowd of sperm and eggs\nDezeen Events Guide\nDezeen Jobs\nHighlights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndonesian restaurant\n\n\n1970s doomsday bunker\n\n\nD-Day Museum\n\n\nUnusual Indian houses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\nComments\nSubmit a story\nAdvertise\nPrivacy notice\nContact\nSeries\nInterviews\nOpinion\nTalks\nVideos\nArchitecture\nInteriors\nDesign\nTechnology\nMagazine\nAwards\nJobs\nEvents Guide\nShowroom\nSchool Shows\nCourses",

While the mobile devices are handy, are people \u2013 especially the affluent baby-boomers who are making the real estate market, going to give up their more-traditional homestead to live in a 320sf tin can?\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/petertaylor/2016/07/19/meet-kasita-the-micro-housing-start-up-thats-about-to-revolutionize-real-estate/\nYou can tell immediately that Jeff Wilson, the 42-year old founder of Kasita, an Austin-based micro-housing start-up, has been courting venture capital. He has his sales pitch nailed\u2014which is pretty impressive for a former university dean and professor who used to live in a dumpster.\nWhen I ask Wilson what fundamental problem his company is solving he tells me without flinching: \u201cKasita is on the verge of disrupting the urban housing market in ways not seen in real estate and development in 150 years.\u201d Wilson\u2019s confidence may just be spot on. And perfectly timed.\nOver the past decade my wife and I have asked each other countless times why everything else we own is completely mobile with the glaring exception of real estate. It\u2019s not an unreasonably philosophical question. Every current aspect of our personal and business lives\u2014from banking and corporate communications to reading the news or planning a vacation\u2014now runs entirely off of five mobile devices and a wireless hotspot. So why do we still sleep in a house every night with two-foot thick brick walls that hasn\u2019t moved an inch in 128 years?\nSeeing a massive, mobility-starved void in the dead center of one of the largest segments of the US economy (while living in a dumpster), Wilson is betting that his tech-stuffed, 320-square foot, portable living capsule (a.k.a. casita, or \u201csmall home\u201d) is poised to transform the fundamental concept of what real estate means to a new generation of Millennials, empty nesters, and upwardly mobile creative types (e.g., us) who are looking to trade-in their 30-year mortgage for mobility, simplicity, and financial independence.\nRead full article here:\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/petertaylor/2016/07/19/meet-kasita-the-micro-housing-start-up-thats-about-to-revolutionize-real-estate/\nJim the Realtor\nJim is a long-time local realtor who comments daily here on his blog, bubbleinfo.com which began in September, 2005.

Once again another example of trying the same thing over again. Mobile homes became a generally lower class living area. Note that these started out as 8 feet wide during World War II for temp housing, and got 10 foot wide in the early 1950s.\nBut of course if you watch any of the tiny home shows you see the tiny homes are mobile, move to their site, and presumably could be moved again. So really nothing and has lots of competition. Note also the idea of container conversion to homes as well, which are based on 8\u00d740 modules. (which interestingly is the size of the house cited)\nAgain the major issue will be zoning and building codes to put these anywhere. Even in areas with just deed restrictions these units could not be the primary home on a lot. (most deed restrictions contain minimum square footage requirements).\nName on July 24, 2016 at 1:25 am\nRick Clark:\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how much they like living in someoone else\u2019s fart cloud.\u201d\nYou need to pay attention to Kickstarter.

For those who can\u2019t deal with this draining process, there may be a solution for you in the form of a tiny portable apartment called Kasita, where users can simply have their apartment picked up and installed in a building elsewhere.\nProfessor Dumpster\nKasita is a housing startup by Dr. Jeff Wilson also known as \u2018Professor Dumpster\u2019, an environmental science professor at Huston-Tillotson University. He got his nickname from the Dumpster Project, in which he lived in a dumpster for a year to experiment with sustainable living in compact environments. The curious experiment was triggered one day while he was working in his office.\n\u201cI looked out into the parking lot, and this gate was opening,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone was about to throw something into the dumpster and I said, \u2018Man that\u2019s it. I need to move into one of these guys.\u2019\u201d\nThe compact nature of the dumpster appealed to his theory that the less cluttered our lives, the more time we have to devote to more meaningful things, resulting a happier life. \u201cBy converting a dumpster into a home, we are experimenting with innovative ways to live with less, and giving environmental education an engaging platform,\u201d he says.\nDr. Wilson found the dumpster living experience surprisingly pleasant, and with the project deemed a success, he teamed up with a lead industrial designer named Remy Labesque in order to apply the concept to real housing. They wanted a space that would be low-rent (even in the heart of the city), transportable, and available for short term leasing for people living alone.\n\u201cI told him, I want you to design something more like an iPhone than a micro-apartment or a container,\u201d Dr. Wilson said, recounting a conversation with Labesque. \u201cI want you to throw out everything you know about housing\u2014and he didn\u2019t even know a whole lot\u2014and make something really iconic.\u201d\nPortable Home\nThe resulting design was of an apartment can be individually moved and replaced. The compact homes, which are 208 square feet and built from glass and steel, are fitted into empty slots on a building made up of metal racks.\n\u201cIt enables us to go into very small spaces,\u201d explains Dr. Wilson. \u201cThe entire footprint of that rack is only about 1,000 square feet or so. So it allows us to move into unused, previously unusable pieces of land.\u201d\nIn cities that have Kasita support, users can press a button on an app to call a moving truck that removes your apartment and places it into an available slot in the city that you are moving to.\nEven as the outer mechanics of the building are impressive on its own, the inner space of the Kasitas is equally stunning because each apartment comes standard with loads of smart tech. With hands-free technology, you can darken the glass for privacy, adjust temperature and lighting, and even play music. Other features include a washer and dryer, a walk-in shower, and a full kitchen out of which slides a queen size bed.\nThe walls are lined with modular tiles that can be pulled out and rearranged, allowing the renter or owner to create a personalized living space. \u201cYou could take a modular tile out of the wall and plug in, say, a clock,\u201d Dr. Wilson says. \u201cOr you could take out three vertical tiles and plug in a mirror. You could take out six, and plug in a TV.\u201d\nIn the initial stages, the Kasita units will have to plug into an existing electrical grid. But in the future, the company plans to power the buildings through solar energy stored in Tesla batteries. Rainwater collection is also a potential feature that is being considered.\nThe company is planning to roll out the first rack of Kasita apartments to be built in Austin, Texas by spring 2016, with an additional 10 cities by 2017. The apartments are projected to go for half the market rate and will lease for around $600.\nTAGS\nentrepreneurship\nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\nStart\nFamilies as Impact Investors: a Toolkit for Purposeful Investing\nStart\nGenes: On the Agenda for Cutting-Edge Families\nStart\nWhy You Should Care About ESG\nStart\nFive Critical Questions for Family Offices\nStart\nFamily Business and the American Dream\nStart\nHow to Get Your Family Business Started on Social Media\nSEARCH ARTICLES\nTAGS\nAnders S\u00f6rman-Nilsson argentina boundaries business carvajal climate change controversy covid crisis management enterprise entrepreneurship ESG facts family family business family business branding Family Business Voice family council family office family relationships forward foundation governance india indigenous family business innovation Italy japan leadership longevity manufacturing nepotism Peru philanthropy podcast succession sustainability technology tharawat The Family Business Voice top 10 tradition USA women women in business\nTharawat Magazine inspires family businesses and entrepreneurs with story-telling and best practice through every step of their journey as they start, grow, and sustain their companies.\nContact us: info@tharawat-magazine.com\nAbout us Media Kit Tharawat Magazine Submission Guidelines\n\u00a9 Orbis Terra Media\nX",

Discounts are available to customers who purchase multiple units.\nThe mobile home \u2013 which encompasses 352 square feet (33 square metres) \u2013 is being shown this week at the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference in Austin.\n\"Kasita is on a mission to solve the housing crisis in America with our seamlessly smart, beautifully designed light homes,\" the team said. \"We have taken a product design approach to housing in a way never before imagined.\"\nThe company is targeting a range of customers, including \"urban millienials, upwardly mobile singles, the shrinking middle class, and retirees\".\nDesigned by the company's in-house team, the rectilinear dwelling has a steel structural framework and is clad in aluminium composite panels. Windows are made of glass that tints automatically or on demand.\nThe split-level interior contains a glass-walled lounge area, a living room that doubles as a bedroom, a full kitchen, and a bathroom with a shower. Clerestories and 10-foot-high ceilings (three metres) help the space feel bright and airy.\nThe dwelling is larger than Kasita's initial prototype, which totalled 319 square feet (30 square metres). \"The layout has changed and we\u2019re constantly improving based on user feedback,\" the team said.\nMany of the home's systems and devices are controlled by a mobile app, including lights, window shading devices, an entertainment system, thermostats, smoke detectors and a video \"doorbell\".\nThe smart home also comes equipped with Amazon Echo Dot, a hands-free device that enables users to control systems with their voice.\n\"We're providing a completely integrated home automation experience,\" the team said. \"Kasita is easy and integrated on day one.\"\nIn the future, the company \u2013 which has grown from three employees to 22 in the past year \u2013 hopes to expand the concept and attract urban developers. Its vision is to create stackable units that can be slotted into a giant framework.\n\"Our first units fit in many untraditional spots \u2014 backyards, rooftops, a desert getaway,\" the team said. \"Our next models will be stackable and designed as high-density solutions for urban environments.\"\nKasita was founded by Jeff Wilson, a former environmental studies professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin. Wilson spent several years working for IBM in California in the last 1990s, during the dot-com boom.\nFor a year, from 2014 to 2015, Wilson lived in a modified trash dumpster in Austin, which led him to start Kasita. Called The Dumpster Project, the experiment was meant to explore sustainable practises and new ways of living.\nOther tiny houses include micro cabins designed by Harvard students for stressed-out city dwellers and a prefabricated dwelling by Avava Systems with components that are shipped in flat-pack boxes.\nRelated story\nKasita unveils prefabricated tiny houses that slot into \"racks\" like wine bottles\nRead more: Residential architecture and interiors USA Houses American houses SXSW Micro homes Micro apartments Kasita Architecture Residential\nSubscribe to our newsletters\nYour email address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore images\nShare and comment\n8 comments\nMore\nArchitecture\nInteriors\nDesign\nTechnology\nRecommended stories\nDyson aims to \"disrupt\" with launch of first headphones\n\"Building 1.5 million homes is not the same as solving the housing crisis\"\nConen Sigl references \"robust\" industrial structures for Westhof housing in Zurich\nCookFox to convert former New York City prison into affordable housing\nCosmic reveals updated \"high-quality\" model of all-electric micro home\nBarbie exhibition aims to show toy is \"worthy proposition from a design point of view\"\nEight micro interiors that make the most of their small space\nPeris+Toral Arquitectes uses stone for social housing block in Mallorca\nLatest from Dezeen Showroom\nRoyal Twin coat stand by SoldiDesign\nAmsterdam tile collection by Realonda\nIn Out Office seating by Alfredo H\u00e4berli for Andreu World\nLe Ville Valmanara tiles by Casalgrande Padana\nSamba dining chair by David Aguirre for Aguirre\nILE modular system by Foster + Partners for Benchmark\nBolete Lounge Bio seating by Patricia Urquiola for Andreu World\nBilbao sofa by Tim Rundle for Morgan\nComments\nVisit our comments page | Read our comments policy\nTop architecture stories\nMost\npopular\nMost\nrecent\n1\nUniversity of Stuttgart uses self-shaping timber for garden show pavilions\n2\nTrace Architecture Office creates bookstore within historic academy\n3\nTen inventive contemporary houses in Austin\n4\nTen unusual Indian houses completed in the last two years\n5\nGiona Bierens de Haan Architectures refreshes Swiss mountain chalet\nStudio Libeskind unveils social housing that feels \"like home\" in Brooklyn\nSOA Architectes completes \"eclectic\" social housing in Parisian park\nLandscape informs design of Montana house by The Ranch Mine\nThe venues set to host the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles\nSubscribe\nSubscribe to\nour newsletters\nYour email address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandel Architects completes \"the largest Passive House building in Canada\"\nFive design and architecture projects by students at Arts University Bournemouth\nPopular\njobs\nFeatured\njobs\n1\nSenior BIM coordinator at Conran and Partners\n2\nPart 2 architectural assistant at Matt Architecture\n3\nAssistant/associate professor of landscape architecture at Harvard Graduate School of Design\n4\nPart 2 architectural assistants/Part 3 architects at Goldstein Heather Architecture\n5\nArchitect at Soda Studio\nBindloss Dawes adds chestnut-clad extension to old Somerset schoolhouse\nEight cleverly organised homes with rooms divided by storage solutions\nDezeen Events Guide\nDezeen Jobs\nHighlights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndonesian restaurant\n\n\n1970s doomsday bunker\n\n\nD-Day Museum\n\n\nUnusual Indian houses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\nComments\nSubmit a story\nAdvertise\nPrivacy notice\nContact\nSeries\nInterviews\nOpinion\nTalks\nVideos\nArchitecture\nInteriors\nDesign\nTechnology\nMagazine\nAwards\nJobs\nEvents Guide\nShowroom\nSchool Shows\nCourses",

Call it a long shot. But basically, he's building tiny self-contained apartments that move when you do.\nJeff Wilson gives me a tour of the first prototype. He's the mastermind behind the Kasita (\"little home\" in Spanish \u2014 only with a \"k\" instead of a \"c\").\nIt's a steel box, about 10 by 20 feet. It's different from typical mobile homes in two ways: It's made for downtown, not the outskirts of a city. And it's swank: dishwasher, washer/dryer and a subwoofer in the floor \u2014 because we can't live without a good sound system. \"It's essential,\" Wilson says. \"Absolutely.\"\nThe Kasita does not have a walk-in closet. Wilson's team has used various tricks to make the place feel bigger: white walls, reflective surfaces, high ceilings (so you get vertically what you don't get horizontally). The front wall \u2014 the part that would face the street \u2014 is a dazzling glass balcony \u2014 fully enclosed, like a display case for a luxury watch, only human sized.\n\"This is really the personal expression space,\" Wilson says. \"So we're leaving that completely clean. No desk, no furniture. You can put plants up there or stand out there and do your yoga, read a book.\"\nWilson has a vision: that this little Kasita will be just one unit in a vast global network. From New York to San Francisco to Dubai to Beijing, large cities will have something called a \"rack\" \u2014 a building edifice, where you can pop in, say, six or nine units. There would be hookup valves for water, electricity and sewage. Just plug in your home like you lock your bike. And when a Kasita renter needs to move, just press a button on your smartphone and have your home meet you ... wherever.\nHe's already leased the land for a rack in Austin. Some units there would go for below-market rates of $600 per month, excluding utilities.\n\"One of the things we're trying to solve for is having your own place, and not getting on Craigslist and finding a bunch of roommates that have too many cats and too much bong water left out on the dining room table,\" Wilson says.\nThis idea \u2014 that today's wandering class needs wandering homes, too \u2014 it resonates, though I ask him about a potential downside. If this takes off, couldn't people be even more disconnected from each other \u2014 and from communities \u2014 than they are today?\nDismissively, Wilson sums up the concern \"that this is going to create some sort of dystopian wandering millennials out there \u2014 you know crazy on Tinder, roaming around the planet in their Kasitas.\"\nHe doesn't buy it.\nNeither does San Francisco-based architect Mark Hogan \u2014 though for different reasons. Hogan writes about tiny homes. He finds it surprising that anyone has built a prototype for a tiny apartment that moves because, he says, it's so unlikely to work.\n\"If you're living in 200 square feet, you can just hire somebody to pack up your stuff and move it fairly easily,\" he says. \"I'm not sure who ... both wants to live in a small space and be locked into this kind of movable apartment idea.\"\nThe idea of a tiny home, often factory made, is not new. In the Netherlands, a company turns shipping containers into housing that's about 8 feet wide and up to 39 feet long. In Portland, Ore., you can rent a tiny hotel room to try out the lifestyle.\nThe Kasita gives the decades-old movement for plug-and-play apartments a new, mobile twist.\nBut, Hogan says, there's a big question mark around how many cities would even want Kasita buildings and whether it could scale up \u2014 the cost of moving, just once, is easily thousands of dollars. There's shipping, the crane you need to lift the Kasita into a rack, the permit to close the street while you move the home. \"That's definitely going to be more expensive, unless there's some kind of magic that I've never heard of in construction that's going to allow that.\"\nThat said, Hogan has moved about a dozen times in 15 years. So yes, he admits, the idea is compelling.\nCopyright 2016 NPR.

It\u2019s 5 p.m. on a Tuesday, and floor-to-ceiling windows flood the space with golden light. The 352-square-foot high-tech tiny home is fashionably furnished in that eminently Pinterest-able sort of way, with succulents on raised stands, chic neutral-toned furniture, and bright white walls. Best of all, it\u2019s not cluttered with all the stuff that fills my own far-dimmer, much older apartment. But as my dog, Phoebe, sniffs out the space where we\u2019re going to spend the night\u2014a brief experiment in tiny living\u2014I wonder: Where would I put all my stuff? \nThere\u2019s a large closet near the bathroom, tucked to the right of the entry; the stairs between the kitchen and the living room roll out to reveal storage bins; a hatch hides cleverly beneath a floor runner, opening into a basement-like space. In newer units, there are built-in bookshelves. The storage is smart but not abundant. Which is precisely the point of tiny living\u2014to pare down our lives to the essentials, following in the footsteps of Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, who famously lived in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year in Austin.\nWilson co-founded Kasita in 2015 with a vision to \u201ctransform urban living and to think about housing in our cities in a new way,\u201d he says. As of April, the Austin-based company, which has 32 employees, had made seven Kasita units, six of which are scattered around Austin. The seventh is embarking on a road trip across the United States to spread the gospel of the smart, modern micro home.\nKasita is available in two configurations\u2014Independent and Community. The Independent unit is 374 square feet, about half the size of a large one-bedroom apartment (Community units are 408 square feet). I unpack my things\u2014even for a night, a tiny home seems to require tidiness\u2014and delight in the Sonos-powered surround sound as I cook dinner. The kitchen is easy to navigate, with plenty of counter space and a two-burner induction stove; the refrigerator and freezer are stacked drawers, roomy enough to fit a week\u2019s groceries.\nThe Kasita is divided into four areas: a full bathroom with shower, the kitchen, a living/sleeping area, and the glass-walled \u201ccube,\u201d a sort of interior porch that hangs off the main unit. Because it\u2019s split into two levels\u2014the kitchen and cube are several steps above the living/sleeping area\u2014it feels more spacious, as if there are more spaces to occupy.\nAfter I finish dinner, I play around with the iPad that controls the lighting, temperature, and TV, and Phoebe and I settle down to watch Netflix. The couch pulls out into a queen-size bed, transforming the living room into a bedroom. It\u2019s a smart design, informed in part by Wilson\u2019s year of dumpster living, when he realized how much space a bed occupies. In the Kasita, he says, \u201cWe thought about every cubic inch of experience within that small space, and we tried to make it as perfect as possible.\u201d And it\u2019s pretty perfect, from the built-in computer nook in the kitchen to the insulated walls and eco-friendly appliances. My only gripes were the bathroom appliances\u2014the bathroom sink was too small to comfortably wash my face and hands\u2014and the couch, which was far less comfortable than the Casper-mattress-equipped bed. Still, I\u2019d happily trade my 1970s-era 680-square-foot apartment for the efficiency and design of a Kasita.\nThat\u2019s exactly what Wilson is hoping for\u2014to attract people sick of living in apartments but who can\u2019t yet afford to buy traditional homes. \u201cThe way it\u2019s always been done is you put together some money, bought a starter home, if you can afford it in the city that you\u2019re in, and then tied yourself to it for 40 years,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cRising student debt, astronomical home prices in a place like Austin, with the lack of supply near the places that folks want to be, the lack of community that you find in the condo builds\u2014we\u2019re looking for innovative solutions to solve all that.\u201d\nA top-of-the-line Independent Kasita costs $129,000 and can be financed by a lender like any other real estate purchase. With a 30-year mortgage at 5 percent interest, your monthly payment would be $692\u2014affordable, until you consider the cost of the land you might put it on.\nOne solution to the land question is to put your home in the backyard of an existing house\u2014although some residential lots in Austin require prohibitively expensive permitting. Another option is to lease a parcel in a tiny home community like Constellation ATX, a 6.2-acre development just south of Austin city limits that offers long-term leases on parcels of land starting at $725 a month (that\u2019d make you a homeowner\u2014but not a landowner\u2014for $1,417 a month). The Kasita Community units are the next frontier, built to be stacked for multifamily dwelling in low- to mid-rise developments on small plots of land, increasing both affordability and density.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve the land issue,\u201d Wilson acknowledges. \u201cWe have to look for innovative ways to get to affordability. We need to think in new and innovative ways about the housing crisis.\u201d The obvious question is whether Kasita homes will retain value over time, given that the equity built through homeownership often has more to do with the appreciation of the land it sits on rather than the value of the building itself.\nI turn the lights off via iPad, roll down the window shades, and sleep peacefully, enveloped in darkness and quiet. The next morning, Phoebe and I walk around East Austin, past small homes in disrepair adjacent to million-dollar rebuilds abutting empty lots selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. It seems fitting that the Kasita showroom is in East Austin, a neighborhood on the front lines of change, grappling with questions of affordability and density and who gets to live where. But if you can find a tiny plot of land in East Austin\u2014or anywhere else\u2014Kasita just might be the home for you.\nPopular Articles\nWhy Is Austin Dating So Cursed?\nA Major Developer\u2019s Collapse Leaves Abandoned Projects Scattered Across Austin\nThe 25 Best Tacos in Austin\n50 Great Dates in Austin\n6 Texas Beaches Just a Short Drive From Austin\nWhat\u2019s With All These Breakups in Austin?\nSubscribe\nNewsletters\nCurrent Issue\nArchives\nTRENDING NOW\n1907\u2019s Chill Summer, and Other Austin Weather Records That Might Surprise You\nThe Highland Lakes Are Rising Again!

Units could also be used for student housing and other populations, executives said.\nBy Foo Foo Festival\nADVERTISER CONTENT\nArts, culture, and more are in store at the 11th Foo Foo Festival\nDevelopers say units will \u201cfeel spacious and full of light\u201d equipped with traditional amenities such as a queen size bed, walk-in shower, refrigerator, convection oven and cooktop, dishwasher and laundry machines.\nEach Kasita will plug into traditional utilities.\nDevelopers say they\u2019ll eventually post prices to rent or buy Kasitas, but say that rents will be at half the market rate for a studio.\nWilson is teaming up with Kasita co-founder Taylor Wilson for the plan, which was announced at the South by Southwest Eco conference this week. The two Wilsons are not related.\nThe Kasitas will be available in Austin beginning in 2016 and in potentially ten other cities starting in 2017. Future Kasita homes could include Portland, Los Angeles, Brooklyn and Stockholm, Sweden.\nIn Austin, the project is slated for two different sites near downtown and in East Austin, Taylor Wilson said. However, a specific location has not been finalized, he added.\nTaylor Wilson announced a micro-unit concept project earlier this year. In March, Taylor Wilson announced a \u2018micro-unit\u2019 apartment project, Spire, for the East Austin area. However a site for that plan is still pending.\nEach unit was an estimated 400 square feet.\nAbout the Author\nClaudia Grisales\nThe Latest\nIsrael-Hamas war latest: Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 18, including 8 children...24m ago\nGlobal stocks mostly rise after Big Tech pulls S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower27m ago\nOasis reunites for tour and ends a 15-year hiatus during Gallagher brothers' feud31m ago\nFeatured\nWhat was that over Atlanta?

Call it a long shot. But basically, he's building tiny self-contained apartments that move when you do.\nJeff Wilson gives me a tour of the first prototype. He's the mastermind behind the Kasita (\"little home\" in Spanish \u2014 only with a \"k\" instead of a \"c\").\nIt's a steel box, about 10 by 20 feet. It's different from typical mobile homes in two ways: It's made for downtown, not the outskirts of a city. And it's swank: dishwasher, washer/dryer and a subwoofer in the floor \u2014 because we can't live without a good sound system. \"It's essential,\" Wilson says. \"Absolutely.\"\nEnlarge this image\nThe Kasita unit comes with a washer and dryer, dishwasher and subwoofer. The floors have bendable tiles, which don't crack during a move.\nKasita\nThe Kasita does not have a walk-in closet. Wilson's team has used various tricks to make the place feel bigger: white walls, reflective surfaces, high ceilings (so you get vertically what you don't get horizontally). The front wall \u2014 the part that would face the street \u2014 is a dazzling glass balcony \u2014 fully enclosed, like a display case for a luxury watch, only human sized.\n\"This is really the personal expression space,\" Wilson says. \"So we're leaving that completely clean. No desk, no furniture. You can put plants up there or stand out there and do your yoga, read a book.\"\nCITIES PROJECT\nLiving Small In The City: With More Singles, Micro-Housing Gets Big\nWilson has a vision: that this little Kasita will be just one unit in a vast global network. From New York to San Francisco to Dubai to Beijing, large cities will have something called a \"rack\" \u2014 a building edifice, where you can pop in, say, six or nine units. There would be hookup valves for water, electricity and sewage. Just plug in your home like you lock your bike. And when a Kasita renter needs to move, just press a button on your smartphone and have your home meet you ... wherever.\nHe's already leased the land for a rack in Austin. Some units there would go for below-market rates of $600 per month, excluding utilities.\n\"One of the things we're trying to solve for is having your own place, and not getting on Craigslist and finding a bunch of roommates that have too many cats and too much bong water left out on the dining room table,\" Wilson says.\nThis idea \u2014 that today's wandering class needs wandering homes, too \u2014 it resonates, though I ask him about a potential downside. If this takes off, couldn't people be even more disconnected from each other \u2014 and from communities \u2014 than they are today?\nAROUND THE NATION\nMaking Room: Can Smaller Apartments Help New York City Grow?\nDismissively, Wilson sums up the concern \"that this is going to create some sort of dystopian wandering millennials out there \u2014 you know crazy on Tinder, roaming around the planet in their Kasitas.\"\nHe doesn't buy it.\nNeither does San Francisco-based architect Mark Hogan \u2014 though for different reasons. Hogan writes about tiny homes. He finds it surprising that anyone has built a prototype for a tiny apartment that moves because, he says, it's so unlikely to work.\n\"If you're living in 200 square feet, you can just hire somebody to pack up your stuff and move it fairly easily,\" he says. \"I'm not sure who ... both wants to live in a small space and be locked into this kind of movable apartment idea.\"\nThe idea of a tiny home, often factory made, is not new. In the Netherlands, a company turns shipping containers into housing that's about 8 feet wide and up to 39 feet long. In Portland, Ore., you can rent a tiny hotel room to try out the lifestyle.\nARCHITECTURE\nForget Big-Box Stores. How About A Big-Box House?\nThe Kasita gives the decades-old movement for plug-and-play apartments a new, mobile twist.\nBut, Hogan says, there's a big question mark around how many cities would even want Kasita buildings and whether it could scale up \u2014 the cost of moving, just once, is easily thousands of dollars. There's shipping, the crane you need to lift the Kasita into a rack, the permit to close the street while you move the home. \"That's definitely going to be more expensive, unless there's some kind of magic that I've never heard of in construction that's going to allow that.\"\nThat said, Hogan has moved about a dozen times in 15 years. So yes, he admits, the idea is compelling.\nThis story aired as part of an All Tech Considered segment on the Internet of Things, click here for the second part of the segment about web-connected home appliances.\nhousing\naustin, texas\nall tech extra\nFacebook\nFlipboard\nEmail\nREAD & LISTEN\nHome\nNews\nCulture\nMusic\nPodcasts & Shows\nCONNECT\nNewsletters\nFacebook\nInstagram\nPress\nPublic Editor\nCorrections\nContact & Help\nABOUT NPR\nOverview\nDiversity\nNPR Network\nAccessibility\nEthics\nFinances\nGET INVOLVED\nSupport Public Radio\nSponsor NPR\nNPR Careers\nNPR Shop\nNPR Events\nNPR Extra\nterms of use\nprivacy\nyour privacy choices\ntext only\n\u00a9 2024 npr\nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor\nBy clicking \u201cAccept All Cookies\u201d or continuing, you agree to the use of cookies, similar tracking and storage technologies, and information about your device to enhance your viewing, listening and user experience, personalize content, personalize messages from NPR\u2019s sponsors, provide social media features, and analyze NPR\u2019s traffic.

That\u2019s why we reinvented the home for the way you actually live. Now available in the United States,\u201d says their video.\nKasita\u2019s founder \u2013 Jeff Wilson, the so called \u201cdumpster dweller\u201d who helped design this micro-modular home \u2013 has been featured on the Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI)/National Community Council (NCC) stage last year in Chicago.\nThey\u2019ve been featured recently on Builder, and previously on NPRs, All Tech Considered.\nAnd now, their compact/tiny version of a modular home is okayed for sale in the states of California and Nevada. Other states too, the company says, are ok or also on the way.\nWhat\u2019s all the Buzz?\n Inquiring industry minds want to know. So some snapshots are warranted.\n\u201cThursday\u2019s closing segment will feature Jeff Wilson of KASITA, who was featured on NPR\u2019s  All Tech Considered segment where he shared his vision on revolutizing [sic] the housing market with prefab, urban housing.  He will encourage attendees to think differently about affordable housing\u2019s future,\u201d glowed MHI.\nNPR crowed, \u201c\u2026there\u2019s a man in Austin, Texas, who has a possible solution. Call it a long shot. But basically, he\u2019s building tiny self-contained apartments that move when you do. Jeff Wilson gives me a tour of the first prototype. He\u2019s the mastermind behind the Kasita (\u201clittle home\u201d in Spanish \u2014 only with a \u201ck\u201d instead of a \u201cc\u201d).\u201d\nKasita is, per NPR\u2019s statements, is \u201c\u2026a steel box, about 10 by 20 feet. It\u2019s different from typical mobile homes in two ways: It\u2019s made for downtown, not the outskirts of a city. And it\u2019s swank: dishwasher, washer/dryer and a subwoofer in the floor \u2014 because we can\u2019t live without a good sound system. \u201cIt\u2019s essential,\u201d [Jeff] Wilson says. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\nHere\u2019s their company\u2019s video.\n\nBuilder said, \u201cIn addition to its ADU, Kasita offers other options, including stackable units designed for multi-family, and a disaster relief model meant to quickly step in and provide a high quality, affordable housing solution.\u201d\n\u201cNot much has really changed in the housing category in almost a century,\u201d said Martyn Hoffmann, Kasita\u2019s CEO, per Builder. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t seen much improved in the output or delivery,\u201d Builder quoted Hoffmann. \u201cThere are very few product categories that can say that. What we are doing, every single day at Kasita, is seeking to disrupt the construction and housing industry by developing a home in the form of a designed, intelligent product. Kasita is compact, intended to utilize and re-utilize every cubic inch, and is delivered with speed in a cost effective manner. The end result is the superior user-experience that the next generation of buyers and renters are looking for.\u201d\nKasita\u2019s Hoffman in His Own Words, Speaking About \u201cTrailers [sic]\u2026\u201d\nAfter his associate was given a stage and a microphone by MHI last year, here\u2019s part of what Hoffman wrote as to why his housing option is better than \u201ctrailers [sic].\u201d\nHow does it look that the President/CEO of the Kasita company, that MHI had that firm\u2019s founder on their stage, is referring to manufactured homes as \u201ctrailers?\u201d\n\u201cHousing the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by these disasters is in itself a national disaster that has to be addressed, and doing it traditionally is not going to yield results fast enough. People need interim and long term housing now. We\u2019re not talking about the infamous formaldehyde trailers [sic] that were deployed during hurricane Katrina \u2014 meant to house people for 12-18 months, but were still being lived in years later,\u201d wrote Hoffman in a post.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about dignified housing that is safe, sufficient, and suitable for people to live in for 3-5 years, or permanently if they wish,\u201d a LinkedIn post by Hoffman.\n\u201cThese units need to be manufactured to comply with state building code standards and be small enough for quick and nimble deployment with easy utility hookups,\u201d Kasita\u2019s president stated.\n\u201cLocal governments need to enact policies that allow for these units to be installed with minimal red tape to get families safely housed in their neighborhoods and communities as fast as possible. The sooner we do this, the sooner our communities can get back to school and work, giving each a foundation to rebuild local economies and flourish once again.\u201d\nFrom the Kasita website.\nComparisons \u2013 Facts\nThey may have their share of tech, but here\u2019s the price for the unit itself. $139,900.\nWant 4 Kasita micro-mods at a time?  They\u2019ll drop the price to $99,000 per their data, shown in the screen capture below.\nBased upon their own website, it sounds like transport, installation, foundation, and other costs are add-ons.\nLet\u2019s go back to that base price.  At 352 square feet, and a base price of $139,900 that works out to be: $397.44 per square foot.\nBuy four at just under 400k, and you\u2019d have dropped that price \u2013 again, before installation, foundation, hookups, etc.- to $283.80 per square foot.\n    As MHProNews has previously noted, Amazon recently launched the sale of container mods. That bears close attention, because the video for that product is way outperforming Clayton\u2019s \u201cHave it Made\u201d video.\n  Virtually all of the affordable housing surveys reveal that what people describe is what manufactured housing offers.\nZillow and others have studied what Millennials and other home buyers are looking for, and most of it reads like a feature/benefits list for manufactured housing. To see an example, click here or the image above.\nIts making more Americans realize \u2013 at the local market level \u2013 what manufactured homes truly are rather than the outdates misconceptions, that\u2019s what publisher and consultant L. A. \u201dTony\u201d Kovach has called the opportunity in disguise for solution and goal oriented industry professionals. ## (News, commentary, analysis.)\n(Image credits are as shown above, and when provided by third parties, are shared under fair use guidelines.)\nSubmitted by Soheyla Kovach to the Daily Business News for MHProNews.com.\n\u2190 Previous Post\nNext Post \u2192\nArchives\n   \n   Select Month\n     August 2024\n  July 2024\n  June 2024\n  May 2024\n  April 2024\n  March 2024\n  February 2024\n  January 2024\n  December 2023\n  November 2023\n  October 2023\n  September 2023\n  August 2023\n  July 2023\n  June 2023\n  May 2023\n  April 2023\n  March 2023\n  February 2023\n  January 2023\n  December 2022\n  November 2022\n  October 2022\n  September 2022\n  August 2022\n  July 2022\n  June 2022\n  May 2022\n  April 2022\n  March 2022\n  February 2022\n  January 2022\n  December 2021\n  November 2021\n  October 2021\n  September 2021\n  August 2021\n  July 2021\n  June 2021\n  May 2021\n  April 2021\n  March 2021\n  February 2021\n  January 2021\n  December 2020\n  November 2020\n  October 2020\n  September 2020\n  August 2020\n  July 2020\n  June 2020\n  May 2020\n  April 2020\n  March 2020\n  February 2020\n  January 2020\n  December 2019\n  November 2019\n  October 2019\n  September 2019\n  August 2019\n  July 2019\n  June 2019\n  May 2019\n  April 2019\n  March 2019\n  February 2019\n  January 2019\n  December 2018\n  November 2018\n  October 2018\n  September 2018\n  August 2018\n  July 2018\n  June 2018\n  May 2018\n  April 2018\n  March 2018\n  February 2018\n  January 2018\n  December 2017\n  November 2017\n  October 2017\n  September 2017\n  August 2017\n  July 2017\n  June 2017\n  May 2017\n  April 2017\n  March 2017\n  February 2017\n  January 2017\n  December 2016\n  November 2016\n  October 2016\n  September 2016\n  August 2016\n  July 2016\n  June 2016\n  May 2016\n  April 2016\n  March 2016\n  February 2016\n  January 2016\n  December 2015\n  November 2015\n  October 2015\n  September 2015\n  August 2015\n  July 2015\n  June 2015\n  May 2015\n  April 2015\n  March 2015\n  February 2015\n  January 2015\n  December 2014\n  November 2014\n  October 2014\n  September 2014\n  August 2014\n  July 2014\n  June 2014\n  May 2014\n  April 2014\n  March 2014\n  February 2014\n  January 2014\n  December 2013\n  November 2013\n  October 2013\n  September 2013\n  August 2013\n  July 2013\n  June 2013\n  May 2013\n  April 2013\n  March 2013\n  February 2013\n  January 2013\n  December 2012\n  November 2012\n  October 2012\n  September 2012\n  August 2012\n  July 2012\n  June 2012\n  May 2012\n  April 2012\n  March 2012\n  February 2012\n  January 2012\n  December 2011\n  November 2011\n  October 2011\n  September 2011\n  August 2011\n  July 2011\n  June 2011\n  May 2011\n  April 2011\n  March 2011\n  February 2011\n  January 2011\n  December 2010\n  November 2010\n  October 2010\n  September 2010\n  August 2010\n  July 2010\n  June 2010\n  May 2010\n  April 2010\n  March 2010\n  February 2010\n  January 2010\n  December 2009\n  November 2009\n  October 2009\n  September 5\n   I-Report News Tips and Comments\nto send MH news, tips, links, documents, facts, comments, or other factory-built housing related suggestions.\nAdvertise with MHProNews to be seen\nAdvertise with MHProNews to be seen\nAdvertise with MHProNews to be seen\nAdvertise with MHProNews to be seen\nLatest\nDaily Business News\n\u2018Monopoly\u2019 \u2013 Justice Dept Sues RealPage for Pricing Scheme \u2018Harming Millions of Renters\u2019-Could DOJ Come After Datacomp and Manufactured Housing Organizations for Similar Claim?

(Courtesy of Kasita)\nMicro-housing builder Kasita is making its first appearance at a ULI event during the 2018 Spring Meeting in Detroit, as it ramps up marketing to developers for its next-generation approach to modular home construction.\n\u201cThis is where construction is going,\u201d said Benji Miller, Kasita\u2019s chief operating officer, as he lounged in a Kasita prototype parked outside the Cobo Center. \u201cWe take a lot of the risk out of the process.\u201d\nThe Kasita unit is available for ULI Spring Meeting attendees to tour, providing a glimpse into how Kasita has reengineered a living environment, including a kitchen, washing machine, and bathroom with shower.\nKasita\u2019s units range from 352 to 408 square feet (33 to 38 sq m) and prices start at about $90,000. Two designs are available: the Independent, a stand-alone accessory dwelling unit, and Community, a \u201cmodular, stackable, high-density product for real estate developers, institutions, governments, and anyone who wants to place multiple units in tight urban spaces,\u201d according to company marketing materials.\nUnits priced at $109,000 are shipped fully equipped with appliances and furniture, including a queen-size bed that slides away to create more living space. Storage space is also available under the floor or in optional cabinets.\nEach unit is wired for an Alexa-like home assistant to control lights and appliances. Eleven-foot-high (3.4 m) ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, and elevated spaces are designed to give the units the look and feel of a larger space.\nWhile companies have been pitching modular concepts for decades, rising construction and labor costs make prefab more enticing for developers, the company says. \u201cWe think the time is right for this,\u201d said Dason Whitsett, the principal architect. Construction in a \u201ccontrolled factory environment is not subject to the whims of the market,\u201d he said.\nStandardized and tightly controlled manufacturing can eliminate many of the past problems that builders have experienced using modular designs, Miller says. No welding is required in the process of site prep, he says. \u201cWe have spent a lot of time looking at framing and production,\u201d Miller says.\nSome of Kasita\u2019s models come fully furnished with convertible furniture hooked up to Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant system. (Courtesy of Kasita)\nWork is expected to begin later this year on a mixed-use, 24-unit project in Denver. The company also has a commitment for a project in New York, Miller says.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hitting places that are being hit hard by the housing crisis and the lack of supply of housing,\u201d Matt McPheely, the company\u2019s head of sales, told the Denver Post. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a manufacturing approach to housing, which enables high precision and scalability.\u201d\nIn California, the company has been touting the use of the units for granny flats, but the company\u2019s focus is on larger projects. Four to five stories is the ideal height for projects, the executives say.\n\u201cThe assumption is we are a tiny home,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWe are really a modular builder.\u201d\nKasita founder Jeff Wilson famously spent a year living in a 33-square-foot (3 sq m) Dumpster \u201cto test the limits of habitable space,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website. The two-year-old firm has raised $11.2 million in investments, including support from Gary Keller, the founder of Keller Williams, the residential brokerage firm.\nRead more about Kasita in the summer 2018 issue of Urban Land.\nCMRffIsX0To\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nPrint\nCopy\nEmail\nPublic\nKevin Brass\nKEVIN BRASS writes regularly about property and development for the New York Times International Edition and the Financial Times.\nMOST RECENT\nULI LEADERSHIP // PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS\nLeading Nevada to a Sustainable Future\nDEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION // RETAIL\nIn Brief: 25 Chain Retailers Expanding Across North America\nDEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION // INFRASTRUCTURE \u2013 TRANSPORTATION AND TRANSIT\nLas Vegas Betting on Bus Rapid Transit to Spur Development Along Key Corridors\nISSUES AND TRENDS // LEADERSHIP\nUL Interview: Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman\nISSUES AND TRENDS // AFFORDABLE HOUSING\nThe Hidden Logic of India\u2019s Housing Called \u201cSlums\u201d\nRELATED CONTENT\nULI LEADERSHIP\nFormer Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett Appointed ULI Fellow to Steer Urban Development and Downtown Revitalization Efforts\nAugust 19, 2024\nRESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY // MULTIFAMILY\nAfter Surfside: New Regulations and Skyrocketing Insurance Premiums Strain Condo Owners\nAugust 16, 2024\n \u2022 \nHannah Miet\nRESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY // DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION\n10 Questions for Investors to Ask Climate-Risk Analytic Providers\nAugust 14, 2024\n \u2022 \nJuan Pablo Quintero\nDEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION // RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY\nDenver: A Renaissance on the South Platte Riverfront\nAugust 13, 2024\n \u2022 \nLaura Newman\nLoad More\nE-NEWSLETTER\nThis Week in Urban Land\nSign up to get UL articles delivered to your inbox weekly.\nEmail address\nSubmit\nThe mission of the Urban Land Institute: Shape the future of the built environment for transformative impact in communities worldwide\nExplore Urban Land Magazine\nTopics\nProperty Types\nMarkets\nAbout Urban Land\nCurrent Issue\nArchives\nAdvertisers\nAdvertise With Urban Land\nSponsored Posts\nULI Corporate Partner Program\nEditorial Calendar\nULI Marketplace\nAbout ULI\nULI Events\nULI Mission Priorities\nContact Us\nLegal Notices\nGet Updates\nJoin ULI\n\u00a92024 Urban Land Institute.

The company is even working to develop interchangeable wall tiles so you can slot in tiles with shelving, bike racks, or storage instead of hammering into your walls.\n\u201cThis is like the iPhone of smart homes,\u201d CEO Jeff Wilson told me while we lounged in a Kasita model docked on Austin\u2019s east side. \u201cIt becomes an extension of yourself.\u201d\nKasita will be available to preorder online starting April 5. The company hasn\u2019t revealed pricing yet, but Wilson said the mortgage will cost less than rent in cities like New York and San Francisco. There\u2019s an option to rent a Kasita instead of buy one.\nKasita\nKasita gives new meaning to the phrase \u201cmobile home.\u201d\nThe homes are also mobile, with a unique docking system that will let you take them wherever you want to move as long as the city you\u2019re relocating to also has Kasita docks. Austin is the first and only city with docking stations, so you can slot in your house and stack them up to 10 stories high, but the company is working out deals with other cities to allow developers to build docking stations. Imagine being able to take your house with you when you get a job in a new city, and simply paying a monthly fee to slot it into a new station.\nI\u2019m not sure I could ever live a tiny home with a partner, but for single urbanites trying to save money on rent, this might be the perfect solution.\nKasita is a finalist in the South by Southwest Interactive Innovation Awards. The winner will be announced Tuesday night.\nMacworld is your best source for all things Apple.

Units could also be used for student housing and other populations, executives said.\nDevelopers say units will \u201cfeel spacious and full of light\u201d equipped with traditional amenities such as a queen size bed, walk-in shower, refrigerator, convection oven and cooktop, dishwasher and laundry machines.\nEach Kasita will plug into traditional utilities.\nDevelopers say they\u2019ll eventually post prices to rent or buy Kasitas, but say that rents will be at half the market rate for a studio.\nWilson is teaming up with Kasita co-founder Taylor Wilson for the plan, which was announced at the South by Southwest Eco conference this week. The two Wilsons are not related.\nThe Kasitas will be available in Austin beginning in 2016 and in potentially ten other cities starting in 2017. Future Kasita homes could include Portland, Los Angeles, Brooklyn and Stockholm, Sweden.\nIn Austin, the project is slated for two different sites near downtown and in East Austin, Taylor Wilson said. However, a specific location has not been finalized, he added.\nTaylor Wilson announced a micro-unit concept project earlier this year. In March, Taylor Wilson announced a \u2018micro-unit\u2019 apartment project, Spire, for the East Austin area. However a site for that plan is still pending.\nEach unit was an estimated 400 square feet.\nA new AI money-making system is taking over Singapore\nCommitTips\n|\nAd\nLearn More\nYour premier men\u2019s tele-health clinic\nUnlock better performance with a quick 3-min survey\nOfNoah\n|\nAd\nGet $10 ActiveSG Anniversary Credits.

But have you heard about the city\u2019s micro-housing startup? Instead of developing cutting-edge apps, Kasita is developing cutting-edge homes.\nCapitalizing on the tiny house trend of the last decade, Kasita (named after the Spanish for \u201clittle house\u201d) aims to take things a step further. The company has launched a line of 352-square-foot prefabricated micro-homes, whose various systems (everything from lighting to thermostats to window shading) are effectively controlled by a mobile app.\nDesigned to be affordable, mobile, and compact \u2014 and incredibly chic \u2014 Kasita\u2019s housing units are truly unlike anything else on the housing market today. The company unveiled its newest prototypes, which are being sold for $139,000, at SXSW 2017. Each home comes with a fridge, walk-in shower, convection oven, washer/dryer, cooktop, and queen-size bed (that can be tucked away).\nAccording to their website, they currently offer two primary products: a standalone Accessory Dwelling Unit, and a stackable product designed to fit in tight urban spaces. However, there are plans to increase offerings in the future. As Kasita expands, they\u2019ll begin offering homes for rent, as well as larger family units.\nSo, how did it all begin? It's almost Austin legend at this point. Kasita was started by a former Huston-Tillotson professor, Jeff Wilson, who is known around town as Professor Dumpster. That\u2019s because, for an entire year, Wilson lived in a 33-square-foot dumpster on the grounds of Huston-Tillotson, as part of an experiment to teach his students about sustainability and the benefits of simple living.\nIn addition, he and his partner, local writer and artist Clara Bensen, frequently take minimalist sojourns around the world with little else than their toothbrushes and passports in tow. Kasita was clearly a likely evolution of Wilson\u2019s interests.\nAnd those interests go further than just creating minimalist-chic, tiny dwellings. Kasita also aims to be a response to the high-stress housing crisis in Austin by revolutionizing the way we think about our homes. Rather than contributing to a city culture that continues to price out its inhabitants, Kasita\u2019s approach is to create affordable, innovative homes that can ostensibly fit anywhere \u2014 even in the heart of downtown.\nCULTUREMAP EMAILS ARE AWESOME\nGet Austin intel delivered daily.\n5 thrift, warehouse, and art sales this weekend for unique Austin finds\nBy Sam LauronJul 10, 2024 | 5:44 pm\nThere's always something you've never seen before at Austin's City-wide Vintage Sale. City-wide Vintage Sale/Facebook\nAs the temperatures rise, staying home in the nice, cold A/C is one of the most appealing activities (aside from taking a dip in Barton Springs).

Admission is $10 for adults and free for children 12 and under. If you can\u2019t make it out this weekend, the event will be back August 17-18 and again September 14-15.\nSo So Spiffy\nSo So Spiffy is a luxury staging and design company that services both Austin and Birmingham, Alabama.

The base model will start to roll out of the Austin facility this year at $139,000 and Kasita hopes to offer upgrade paths for those interested in even more smart home technology. \nKasita CEO and co-founder Jeff Wilson started the company after experimenting with living in a dumpster \u2014 for a year.\nWilson was a professor of environmental science at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin when, in 2014, he attempted to renovate and live in a 33-square-foot dumpster on the university campus to see how much space people really need to live comfortably. Wilson's students called him \u201cProfessor Dumpster.\u201d\nWilson in his dumpster home\n\u201cIt was absolutely insane,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cI just wanted to try it as an experiment. What happens when you push the absolute limits of small and base level?\u201d\nWilson learned that while a dumpster-sized house might be too small, people could certainly downsize their living space and still live comfortably and perhaps even more conveniently if the house was designed well. \nInside Kasita's Tiny Home\n\u201cThis is a 12,000-pound piece of hardware filled with software,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cI don't think the Internet of Things are really useful until it becomes the Internet of experience.\u201d\nWilson isn't messing around. At first glance, some technology in the Kasita home may a wee bit off-the-shelf consumer-y, but underneath it all is a robust RTI processor.\nWhat's inside:\nDoorBird doorbell and camera\nLutron Radio RA lighting control\nNexus 21 TV lift\nSonos gear with custom driver\nAmazon Dot\nAnthem AV receiver for the \u201chome theater\u201d\nOrigin Acoustics speakers and subwoofer\nNebia water-efficient shower\nRTI processor and iPanel app\nKasita wanted the technology to be so intuitive it's second nature to the user, so a new homeowner could enter the home and immediately be able to use the system. The company created a customized app interface for the RTI system as well as several preprogrammed environmental settings to fit the \u201cmoods,\u201d equivalent to other control system's \u201cscenes.\u201d \nThe morning \u201cwake up\u201d mood is automatically initiated, turning on the lights and a favorite radio station. Another group of personalized settings can be used when the homeowner returns in the evening. Water and energy use can also be easily monitored and optimized by the user.\n\u201cWe knew a couple things we wanted right off the bat,\u201d explains Jason Jaynes, head of technology, Kasita. \u201cWe wanted automation and control, lighting, audio and video. We wanted to make the interface as intuitive as it could possibly be. We wanted the interface to present obvious options to [the user]. We knew we were dealing with a tiny space, so we wanted to work with someone who had expertise working with big systems but also had respect for doing the same thing in a small space.\u201d \nThat led Kasita right to Austin-based integration firm Audio Zeal and owner Ragan Mena, who designed and installed the system in Kasita's demo home at SXSW. Audio Zeal's demo system will act as a basis for all other Kasita homes going forward.\n\u201cI identified with the company right away,\u201d says Mena. \u201cMy office is about as small as the [Kasita] house itself. Putting a lot of technology into a smaller space isn't something I normally get to do on a professional level. It's a totally different project, because even though a light switch may be closer to you, it's still great to be able to create scenes and have the home work perfectly for the homeowner.\u201d\nKasita looked to Mena as a technology guide. He had a lot of experience with RTI, which led to Kasita installing an RTI processor with the iPanel app. The same was true with the other components in the home.\n\u201cWe did some investigation into other control systems, but we felt comfortable going with RTI,\u201d says Jaynes. \u201cOrigin Acoustics has a reputation for being the best in the industry. We installed Sonos because streaming music is so important, plus Sonos offers the widest range of interoperability.\u201d\n\u201cTo get all these systems to play together, you have to be hands on at some point in the build process,\u201d continues Jaynes. \u201cBut we wanted to eliminate that need for the consumer, so when a consumer walks in day one, they are handed a QR code and download an app and everything is ready to go.\u201d\nLong term, Kasita wants to move away from the dependency of RTI or any other control system. The company plans to develop something in-house. \n\u201cWe'll look to replace a lot of the technology we licensed and move to building that technology \u2014 the stuff that will ultimately be the brains of the home \u2014 in-house,\u201d says Jaynes. \nKasita Expands the Industry by Changing the Paradigm\nThe Kasita units are available for reservation nationwide. Right now, you can order standalone units to put on a plot of land or a backyard. These are called accessory dwelling units. \nKasita's long-term goal is to move to a high density solution and work with developments to build and stack many Kasita units in apartment complexes. \n\u201cWe wanted to take the same type of technology that millionaires have access to, bring that into the Kasita system and provide it to users on a budget,\u201d says Jaynes. \u201cRight now, there's a divide in the industry. There's a lot of complexity and a lot of noise, a lot of confusion, when you try to take five or six smart home products off the shelf at Best Buy and integrate them. Then, on the other end of the spectrum, there are these multimillion-dollar homes. We just said to ourselves, there must be a better way for the majority of people to have access to this technology.\u201d\nThat's why Wilson didn't want to design the Kasita tiny home like a normal house. He wanted to design it like a product.\n\u201cYou have to think about the whole home, not just the walls and the high voltage material and the wiring, but how does this all come together?\u201d says Jaynes. \u201cThe way you get there is to design a house like you'd design a car.\u201d\nWhen it gets off the ground, Kasita may have a leg up on most traditional home builders. The technology isn't an added feature of the home, it's inherently part of the home, which Kasita hopes will enable it to become fully integrated into a homeowner's experience. \n\u201cOur vision is to not only provide home automation and control but to make the homeowner's living experience better,\u201d adds Jaynes. \u201cWe want them to be able to say, 'I get my best night of sleep in my Kasita' and 'My Kasita is helping me to learn to be a more efficient homeowner.' There's this whole notion of going beyond home automation, and it's cool and people are excited about it, but the question is how we take the technology we're seeing and turn it into something more.\u201d\nKasita is also working to turn the tide of the housing market, especially as it affects millennials. Jaynes considers that young professionals want to live in cities but are being pushed out by high rental costs and even higher costs of owning a home in an urban area.\n\u201cThese units give people the ability \u2014 especially young, urban professionals \u2014 to live in dense urban areas with the technology they want and need without having to sacrifice,\u201d says Jaynes.\nPHOTOS: Tour the Kasita Tiny House\nThe \u201cit's cool and people are excited about it\u201d part might be the best news for integrators. Kasita is out there spreading the good word about home automation and control.\nThe reaction at SXSW has been \u201coverwhelmingly positive,\u201d says Jaynes. \u201cThere's a lot of excitement out there.\u201d\n\u201cThrough this past week, we've watched the tours go through the house,\u201d adds Mena. \u201cThere were so many inquisitive people coming through who have never seen an automation before. It was an eye-opening experience for people to see this.\u201d\nPage 1\nIf you enjoyed this article and want to receive more valuable industry content like this, click here to sign up for our digital newsletters!\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nFollow\nChelsea Cafiero:\nChelsea Cafiero is Senior Web Editor of CE Pro.

Unfortunately, real estate in these areas is often not within budget, or there's simply no real estate to be found as space is becoming increasingly limited.\nWe'd like to introduce you to an Austin company that's trying to solve that problem by taking the \"tiny home\" concept to a whole other level.\nProfessor Dumpster\nYou may not have heard of Dr. Jeff Wilson, or the company he recently founded, Kasita, but maybe \"Professor Dumpster\" rings a bell. Wanting to teach his Huston-Tillotson University students about sustainability and the excessiveness of the typical single-family house, Wilson transformed a 33-square-foot dumpster into a living space and resided there for a year. While the dumpster had its downfalls, it also had its advantages: it was highly affordable, it could be moved from one location to another, it provided short commute times and made it easier for Wilson to spend more time out in the Austin neighborhoods he loves.\nThat got the professor thinking, and after teaming up with an industrial designer, manufacturer and micro condo unit developer, they designed a compact home with a focus on simplicity, elegance, comfort and functionality: the Kasita was born.\nCompact Urban Living\nDeveloped to revolutionize urban living, Kasita homes are compact, pre-fabricated, portable units that fit into a larger grid structure of up to 9 units (3 units across, by 3 units high). Since each unit is only 208 square feet, with 10-foot ceilings, each grid can fit into a space of about 1,000 square feet. While this might give new meaning to the term \"micro condo\", units are actually 30% bigger than shipping container condos that have become popular in recent years.\nFunctional Space\nSince units are so small, every living space has been maximized to be as functional as possible. Believe it or not, each unit is equipped with a fridge, oven, dishwasher, washer/dryer, walk-in shower, queen-sized bed, desk, and table with storage spaces built into the walls. Walls are made up of individual tiles that can be customized for whatever purpose you like: tiles can hold shelving, outlets, speakers and much more.\nSmart Technology\nAside from using space efficiently, all Kasita homes are outfitted with smart home technology. This allows homewoners to control settings with a touch of a button on their phone, have lights, A/C and heating automatically adjust to their specifications as soon as they get home, use voice commands to turn on some music or roll out the bed, and much more. A grid system will provide Kasita homes with electricity, but future energy sources could include solar power and rain water.\nAffordability and Location\nWith real estate markets trending upwards, people can no longer afford to live in the cities they love. Kasita homes will be about half the market rate of a studio apartment. Launching 2016, right here in Austin, that means these homes will retail for about $600/month. Another ten cities will be home to these units by 2017, including Denver, Seattle, NYC, and Stockholm. Eventually, a large enough network will exist so that people can move their unit between a variety of major cities. That's right, the entire unit is built to be portable, allowing you to be flexible on where you live.\nIt's obvious that Kasita homes (and micro condos in general) aren't for everyone, but for singles, young professionals and millennials who want to work, play and live downtown, they certainly present a feasible way to do so. What do you think of the micro condo concept? Will you try to snag a Kasita home when they hit the Austin real estate market next year?\nPOSTED BY MARY ANN CASTRO ON OCTOBER 24TH, 2015\nRELATED LINKS\nAustin: The Best City for Millennials\nHow To Live Car-Free In Austin\nCondo Developments To Watch Out For In Downtown Austin\nFACEBOOK SHARE THIS POST ON FACEBOOK\nTWITTER TWEET THIS POST ON TWITTER\nEMAIL SEND A LINK TO POST VIA EMAIL\nLeave A Comment\nFull Name- required\nEmail Address- required\nWebsite Link\ne.g. yourwebsitename.com\nComment- required\nSUBMIT COMMENT\nPLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS IS KEPT PRIVATE UPON POSTING.\nBLOG NAVIGATION\nALL CATEGORIES\nAUSTIN REAL ESTATE\nSAN ANTONIO REAL ESTATE\nREAL ESTATE ADVICE\nNEIGHBORHOOD PROFILES\nJBGOODWIN REALTORS\u00ae NEWS\nLIVING IN AUSTIN\nLIVING IN SAN ANTONIO\nARCHIVES\nMARCH 2024\nNOVEMBER 2023\nOCTOBER 2023\nSEPTEMBER 2023\nFEBRUARY 2023\nNOVEMBER 2022\nOCTOBER 2022\nSEPTEMBER 2022\nJUNE 2022\nFEBRUARY 2022\nNOVEMBER 2021\nOCTOBER 2021\nAUGUST 2021\nAPRIL 2021\nMARCH 2021\nJANUARY 2021\nNOVEMBER 2020\nOCTOBER 2020\nSEPTEMBER 2020\nAUGUST 2020\nJUNE 2020\nMAY 2020\nAPRIL 2020\nMARCH 2020\nFEBRUARY 2020\nJANUARY 2020\nDECEMBER 2019\nNOVEMBER 2019\nOCTOBER 2019\nSEPTEMBER 2019\nAUGUST 2019\nJULY 2019\nJUNE 2019\nMAY 2019\nAPRIL 2019\nMARCH 2019\nFEBRUARY 2019\nJANUARY 2019\nDECEMBER 2018\nNOVEMBER 2018\nOCTOBER 2018\nSEPTEMBER 2018\nAUGUST 2018\nJULY 2018\nJUNE 2018\nMAY 2018\nAPRIL 2018\nMARCH 2018\nFEBRUARY 2018\nJANUARY 2018\nDECEMBER 2017\nNOVEMBER 2017\nOCTOBER 2017\nSEPTEMBER 2017\nAUGUST 2017\nJULY 2017\nJUNE 2017\nMAY 2017\nAPRIL 2017\nMARCH 2017\nFEBRUARY 2017\nJANUARY 2017\nDECEMBER 2016\nNOVEMBER 2016\nOCTOBER 2016\nSEPTEMBER 2016\nAUGUST 2016\nJULY 2016\nJUNE 2016\nMAY 2016\nAPRIL 2016\nMARCH 2016\nFEBRUARY 2016\nJANUARY 2016\nDECEMBER 2015\nNOVEMBER 2015\nOCTOBER 2015\nSEPTEMBER 2015\nAUGUST 2015\nJULY 2015\nJUNE 2015\nMAY 2015\nAPRIL 2015\nMARCH 2015\nFEBRUARY 2015\nJANUARY 2015\nDECEMBER 2014\nNOVEMBER 2014\nOCTOBER 2014\nSEPTEMBER 2014\nAUGUST 2014\nJULY 2014\nNOVEMBER 2011\nJANUARY 2004\nRSS FEED\nAustin: 512-502-7804\nSan Antonio: 210-787-3759\nJBGoodwin Realtors\nAbout Us\nAgents\nOffices\nOur Listings\nContact Us\nPopular Pages\nSearch Listings\nAustin\nSan Antonio\nHome Evaluation\nReal Estate Blog\nFollow Us\nAUSTIN\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn YouTube\nSAN ANTONIO\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn YouTube\nJBGOODWIN COMMERCIAL\nLinkedIn\nWhen things go wrong, we help make them right.\nAmerican Home Shield\u00ae Hom Protection Plans.\nTo find out more. visit ahshome.com\n\u00a9COPYRIGHT 2024 REAL ESTATE WEBMASTERS ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",

The modular homes can be slotted in and out of a pre-built building fitted with metal frameworks called \u2018racks\u2019, so moving is as easy as renting a flatbed truck to haul your home to a new location, provided it\u2019s in a city where Kasita is available.\nWatch the video below if you\u2019re having a hard time visualizing how it works:\nhttps://plainmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Get-a-move-on-720p.mp4\nThe units come with all the comforts of a normal apartment: showers, a fully-equipped kitchen, a stow-away queen-size bed and a walk-in shower. Hookup valves, connected to municipal utilities, take care of water, sewage and electricity in each Kasita. And then there are the little things that make a house a home, like self-adjusting temperature, or hands-free commands for playing your favorite music and dimming the lights\u2026\nTargeting urban millennials, professionals and singles that have the freedom to jump from city to city, Kasita is gearing up to have their first building in Austin, Texas in 2016, and a unit is rumored to have  monthly rent value of around $600 \u2013 about half the market rate, made possible by local partnerships. Targeted cities in 2017 include New York, Portland, Seattle, and Stockholm.\nKeep tabs on Kasita, they could be in your city next!\nShare this:\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nClick to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)\nAPARTMENTSINNOVATIONJEFF WILSONKASITAMODULAR HOMESNOMADSTARTUP\nKALA BARBA-COURT\nKala is a freelance content writer and photographer currently based in Shanghai.\nRELATED POSTS\nRECENT POSTS\nA SKATEPARK/SCULPTURE TAKES OVER THE SQUARE OF PARIS\u2019S CENTRE POMPIDOU\nAUGUST 26, 2024\nTHIS ICONIC, SEA RANCH-INSPIRED VANCOUVER HOME IS LOOKING FOR ITS NEXT CUSTODIANS\nAUGUST 23, 2024\nA MONOLITHIC GREY-BRICK HOME RISES UP IN SEOUL\nAUGUST 23, 2024\nCATEGORIES\nArchitecture (2,088)\nArt & Culture (818)\nDesign (977)\nPhotography (1,217)\nABOUT US\nLaunched in 2015, Plain Magazine is a space dedicated to proliferate good design and compelling art, spanning creative fields from photography to architecture, from graphic design to fashion.

He thinks we need to shed our preconceptions of housing as dependent on land and instead consider his plug-and-play shelter.\nHis Kasita units are not just tiny homes- the prototype is 208 square feet-, but they fit onto a \u201crack\u201d to become part of \u201ca vertical, high-end, design-yet-affordable, urban trailer park\u201d. \u201cThink about an RV park\u201d, explains Wilson, \u201cit\u2019s a vertical way to do that: so you own your RV and you park it in a slot, this is a structure that these can go vertically.\u201d\nBorn into the zeitgeist of the Tiny House Movement, Kasita goes far beyond size with its housing-as-a-service. \u201cThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, the permitting and the land. And the land\u2019s the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks that need affordable housing. So our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetize that land while providing home ownership to someone.\u201d\nThe Kasita is built according to international building code and the unit and rack structure is zoned as multi-unit housing. Kasita, according to Wilson, isn\u2019t a real estate firm, but a product company. They\u2019re not just selling their \u201ciPhones for housing\u201d, but they\u2019re selling the racks so anyone with a bit of land can create their own \u201cvertical, high-end, urban trailer park\u201d.\nIf Wilson and his team can sell enough racks around the country, these modular units could become truly mobile: the idea is, in the future, owners could request a move via an app on their phone.\n\u201cSo folks aren\u2019t going to be flying around all the time in their Kasitas, but in 5 years let\u2019s say you want to move your Kasita, we can pull you out of that rack, put you on an 18-wheeler truck and move you to another rack or put it in a backyard. So you\u2019re no longer bound to the land that you own your house on and we think that that\u2019s the way that the world is moving.\u201d\nWilson was inspired to attempt to revolutionize housing while, as a college professor, he tried living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for 10 months. In 2016 he built the prototype and later this year he plans to launch the 320-square-foot production model at 3 locations in Austin. There will be an option to rent or buy and while Wilson hasn\u2019t released the price, he says it will be affordable even to a barista.\n  EmailPocketInstapaperReddit\nRelated\nJupe flat-pack prefab is built for comfort & fast deployment\nNovember 28, 2021\nIn \"videos\"\nSweden tests tiny wooden pods as college dorms of the future\nFebruary 7, 2016\nIn \"videos\"\nFamily builds 6 tiny homes for hotel on old Portland parking\nSeptember 3, 2017\nIn \"videos\"\ntags: austin, casita, home size, micro apartments, micro flats, micro home, micro-modular apartments, mobile home, nomadic home, plug and play housing, prefab, simple living, simplicity, small home, small house movement, small space, space-making furniture, space-saving furniture, texas, tiny apartments, tiny home, tiny house\ndocumentaries\nbiokabin\ngotham micro-flats\n(un)housed\nwhat is \u201chome\u201d?\npandemic-proof\ntiny houses\npre-vanlife\nlean urbanism\ncategories\narticles\nvideos\nabout\n*faircompanies\nterms\nnicol\u00e1s boullosa\nkirsten dirksen\ncontact\nmedia kit\nAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (cc) | *faircompanies, since 2007",

(Photo: KASITA)\nMarch 16, 2016 07:31 PM Eastern Daylight Time\nAUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--After three years of R&D, Austin-based housing startup KASITATM revealed its prototype at SXSW\u00ae Interactive, where it was awarded the 2016 SXSW Innovation Award in the Smart Cities category.\n\u201cUrban housing is perhaps the single most important factor in facing the economic, environmental and social challenges that face humanity today\u201d\nPost this\nNamed one of 2016\u2019s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company, KASITA is transforming urban living, designing and fabricating housing that is more affordable, adaptable and efficient than anything offered by the status quo.\nKASITA\u2019s futuristic metal and glass housing units measure approximately 300 square feet, catering to the increasing numbers of one and two person households in today\u2019s cities. Units are packed with amenities, smart home tech and custom furnishings that take advantage of every cubic inch of space. Because they are mass-produced, construction costs are kept low and quality high. KASITA units are quickly attached to a patent pending plug-and-play rack, which can be set up in days and quickly hooked up to utility lines. The racks slide into underutilized or unused urban lots that are too small for conventional housing development. A KASITA development is being built in Austin later this year, and there is a great deal of interest from cities across the globe. At SXSW, 14 mayors visited the KASITA prototype, including those from San Jose, Providence and Kansas City, each evaluating KASITA as an affordable solution for their cities.\n\u201cUrban housing is perhaps the single most important factor in facing the economic, environmental and social challenges that face humanity today,\u201d said KASITA founder and CEO Jeff Wilson, aka \u201cProfessor Dumpster,\u201d who lived in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year to determine how little space and stuff a person needs to live a happy life. But Wilson believes the status quo is failing, and failing bad. As the world\u2019s populations urbanize, urban cores are facing extreme housing shortages, driving up housing costs and driving out the middle class as well as artists, creatives, immigrants and young professionals who are the cultural capital that make cities great.\n\u201cEvery aspect of KASITA -- from its high tech prefabricated construction to its ability to set up quickly on discounted land -- was designed to create both an amazing living experience and produce development and living costs that crush traditional site building in terms of affordability,\u201d Wilson said.\n\u201cIn his SXSW keynote, President Obama said we need to tackle big problems in new ways, and I couldn\u2019t agree more. But the last real innovation in housing was 150 years ago, when people started building higher than six stories,\u201d Wilson said. He believes KASITA is a complete break from the current way housing is made and developed, bringing to bear the innovative spirit commonplace in tech to the housing market. \u201cI think it was Albert Einstein who remarked that the housing that created the problem, will not be the housing that solves it.\u201d\nPRESS KIT\nhttps://kasita.com/press/\nContacts\nKASITA\nEileen Buesing, 512-825-6403\npress@kasita.com\nKASITA\n\nHeadquarters: Austin, Texas\nWebsite: kasita.com\nCEO: Jeff Wilson\nEmployees: 10+\nOrganization: PRI\nRelease Summary\nKASITA revealed its micro housing prototype at SXSW, where it was awarded the 2016 SXSW Innovation Award in Smart Cities.

Become a free or sustaining member to read unlimited articles, webinars and ebooks.\nBECOME A MEMBER\nThere are plenty of apps designed to make moving easier, but a new kind of apartment takes tech-driven efficiency to a new level.\nMerging the concepts of micro-housing and on-demand services (as well as downsizing for more affordable living in expensive urban neighborhoods), a college professor designed Kasita, high-tech, compact living cubes that, modular style, can slide into and out of steel frames tucked into undeveloped spaces in urban cores.\nBefore coming up with Kasita, Jeff Wilson, an environmental science professor at the University of Texas at Austin, spent 10 months living in a converted Dumpster in an experiment with cutting down on possessions and tiny housing. He then worked with industrial design firm Frog to create a template for a 208-square-foot, single-occupancy city apartment.\nAccording to Fast Company:\nThe prefab buildings are also fully loaded with smart tech. You can tell the glass to darken if you want privacy, turn on the lights and music, or ask for the morning news. Though the first units will plug into the grid, the startup envisions eventually running them off solar power stored in Tesla batteries and adding features like rainwater collection.\nWhen they want to relocate, renters would press a button on an app that calls for a moving truck to slide the apartment out of the building and drive it to an empty slot in another. Wilson envisions Kasita frames existing in cities around the world. Units can be reconfigured and moved or replaced, depending on local building codes.\n(Credit: Kasita)\nHe also sees Kasita as part of the affordable housing solution. \u201cWe are very confident that these will rent for about half of market for a studio,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cSo in Austin, that is about $600.\u201d\nAustin is the first city set to get a Kasita building, likely next year. Other perspective cities include Seattle, Denver and New York.\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE OUR ARTS & CULTURE EMAIL DIGEST\nOnce a month, we\u2019ll send you the best of Next City\u2019s reporting on how communities are building power through art and simply making life more interesting.

NEWS\nNEWS\nBIO\nSTATS\nVIDEOS\nGAME LOG\nINJURIES\nBack from broken nose\nWilson rushed four times for minus-1 yard and caught two of three targets for 21 yards in Friday's 24-14 preseason loss to the Buccaneers.\nImpact It was revealed during the game that Wilson broke his nose earlier in August, per Alain Poupart of Sports Illustrated, which explains his absence from Miami's second preseason game. Wilson didn't do much in this preseason finale, but he scored a touchdown in the preseason opener against the Falcons. Miami will definitely keep Raheem Mostert, De'Von Achane and rookie fourth-round pick Jaylen Wright on the roster at running back, so Wilson's at risk of being a surprise cut prior to the Sept. 8 regular-season opener against the Jaguars.\n3 DAYS AGO\n\u2022\nROTOWIRE\nNot in uniform Saturday\nWilson, Ahmed and Jaylen Wright aren't in uniform for Saturday's preseason game against Washington, Hal Habib of The Palm Beach Post reports.\nImpact The Dolphins are expected to play a lot of their key players, possibly including RBs Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane. However, it'll be surprising if either of those guys plays beyond the first few drives, which means Chris Brooks should get a ton of playing time if Wilson, Ahmed and Wright are all held out.\nAUGUST 18\n\u2022\nROTOWIRE\nFinds end zone in preseason win\nWilson rushed five times for seven yards and secured three of four targets for 18 yards and a touchdown in the Dolphins' 20-13 preseason win over the Falcons on Friday night.\nImpact Wilson drew the start with both Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane sitting out, but as his final line implies, the veteran back could barely get anything going on the ground. However, Wilson showed off his trademark pass-catching acumen with solid work through the air, and he recorded Miami's first touchdown of the night on a six-yard reception early in the second quarter. Wilson did see rookie fourth-round pick Jaylen Wright, who entered the game after him, impress with 55 rush yards and a score on the ground, and the talented Tennessee product represents Wilson's biggest threat to a roster spot.\nAUGUST 10\n\u2022\nROTOWIRE\nSky \u27a1\ufe0f El Jefe\nAUGUST 10 \u2022 YOUTUBE\nMMQB Week 16: Christmas Brings Gifts for Ravens, Lions and Even Jets\nLinks to all of our coverage from NFL Sunday, including conversations with Robert Saleh, Dan Campbell, Jared Goff, Patrick Queen, Jeff Wilso...\nDECEMBER 27, 2023\n\u2022\nCHARLOTTEOBSERVER.COM\nQuiet again in No. 3 role\nWilson rushed two times for five yards during Sunday's 30-0 win over the Jets. He also secured one of two targets for one yard.\nImpact Wilson continues to handle a clear depth role with Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane both healthy. It's difficult to imagine a path for Wilson to handle a relevant workload without at least one of the starters ahead of him missing time, meaning he remains off the fantasy radar heading into a key Week 16 matchup against Dallas.\nDECEMBER 19, 2023\n\u2022\nROTOWIRE\nChris Perkins: Jeff Wilson Jr., Emmanuel Ogbah typify the character of 2023 Dolphins\nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \u2014 It couldn\u2019t have been easy for Miami Dolphins running back Jeff Wilson Jr. to watch fellow running backs Raheem Moster...\nNOVEMBER 30, 2023\n\u2022\nNEWSOBSERVER.COM\nActive Friday, likely as No. 2 back\nWilson is active and is expected to serve as the Dolphins' top backup running back behind starter Raheem Mostert in Friday's game against the Jets with De'Von Achane (knee) inactiv...\nImpact In Achane's return from injured reserve during the Dolphins' Week 11 win over the Raiders, Wilson found himself inactive while Miami went with Mostert, Achane and Salvon Ahmed as its three running backs. However, with Ahmed suffering a season-ending foot injury in that contest and with Achane now sidelined for at least the Week 12 game after tweaking his knee in the win over Las Vegas, Wilson will re-enter the Miami backfield mix. Mostert is still expected to see the majority of the snaps and touches at running back Week 12, but while he was available for Weeks 7 through 9 during Achane's stint on IR, Wilson averaged 2.3 carries and 2.3 targets per contest. Given that the Dolphins enter Friday's contest as heavy favorites, Wilson could be in store for more touches than usual if Miami is able to establish a comfortable lead early on.\nNOVEMBER 25, 2023\n\u2022\nROTOWIRE\nJeff Wilson Can Reclaim Prominent Role in Dolphins Offense Against Jets\nDolphins tailback Jeff Wilson admits he\u2019s struggled mentally this season, and that being benched for the Raiders game last week provided a \u201c...\nNOVEMBER 24, 2023\n\u2022\nSUNHERALD.COM\nJeff Wilson Can Reclaim Prominent Role in Dolphins Offense Against Jets\nDolphins tailback Jeff Wilson admits he\u2019s struggled mentally this season, and that being benched for the Raiders game last week provided a \u201c...\nNOVEMBER 24, 2023\n\u2022\nCHARLOTTEOBSERVER.COM\nJeff Wilson Can Reclaim Prominent Role in Dolphins Offense Against Jets\nDolphins tailback Jeff Wilson admits he\u2019s struggled mentally this season, and that being benched for the Raiders game last week provided a \u201c...\nNOVEMBER 24, 2023\n\u2022\nSTAR-TELEGRAM.COM\nBreaking Down the Week 11 Dolphins-Raiders Inactive Info\nJeff Wilson Jr. and Durham Smythe highlight a Dolphins inactive list made up entirely of offensive players\nNOVEMBER 20, 2023\n\u2022\nNEWSOBSERVER.COM\nBreaking Down the Week 11 Dolphins-Raiders Inactive Info\nJeff Wilson Jr. and Durham Smythe highlight a Dolphins inactive list made up entirely of offensive players\nNOVEMBER 20, 2023\n\u2022\nSTAR-TELEGRAM.COM\nJust one touch in debut\nWilson secured his only target for four yards during Sunday's 31-17 loss to the Eagles. He did not record a carry.\nImpact Wilson was an afterthought behind both Raheem Mostert and Salvon Ahmed in his season debut. The veteran may simply still be rusty after having missed the first six games of the season due to multiple injuries, but fantasy managers will want to see him handle a notable workload before considering him a trustworthy lineup option, especially with a matchup against New England's stout defense coming in Week 8.\nOCTOBER 24, 2023\n\u2022\nROTOWIRE\nDolphins activate RB Jeff Wilson Jr. off injured reserve\nJan 1, 2023; Foxborough, Massachusetts, USA; New England Patriots linebacker Jahlani Tavai (48) tackles Miami Dolphins running back Jeff Wil...\nOCTOBER 22, 2023\n\u2022\nNEWSOBSERVER.COM\nDolphins activate RB Jeff Wilson Jr. ahead of Sunday night matchup with Eagles\nThe Dolphins have activated veteran running back Jeff Wilson Jr. off injured reserve, meaning he could take the field for the first time this season when Miami visits Philadelphia...\nOCTOBER 22, 2023\n\u2022\nASSOCIATED PRESS\nReady for season debut\nWilson (ribs/finger) was activated off injured reserve Saturday.\nImpact As a result, the veteran is now slated to make his 2023 season debut. The emergence of Chris Brooks (ankle) and De'Von Achane (knee) likely would have relegated Wilson to a bit of an afterthought in the Dolphins backfield after registering 4.7 yards per carry across 84 carries last season, but with the two rookies on injured reserve, Wilson could serve as an immediate complement to starter Raheem Mostert right from the get-go.\nOCTOBER 22, 2023\n\u2022\nROTOWIRE\nThree straight FPs but still on IR\nWilson (ribs/finger) was a full participant for a third consecutive practice Friday.\nImpact Wilson practiced without limitations this week, and the Dolphins opened up a spot on their 53-man roster by moving fellow running back Chris Brooks (ankle) to injured reserve Friday, so all signs point to the former coming off injured reserve to suit up Sunday against the Eagles. Once he's officially activated, Wilson will likely leapfrog Salvon Ahmed as the primary backup to Raheem Mostert, at least until productive rookie De'Von Achane (knee) returns from his own IR stint.\nOCTOBER 21, 2023\n\u2022\nROTOWIRE\nOpens week with full practice\nWilson (ribs/finger) was a full participant in practice Wednesday, Travis Wingfield of the Dolphins' official site reports.\nImpact Wilson's 21-day window to return from injured reserve was opened last Wednesday, but he remained sidelined for the Week 6 win over Carolina. After being limited in practice heading into that game, Wilson has progressed to full participation as the Dolphins begin their preparation for Sunday's game against the Eagles. If Wilson is activated from injured reserve, he'll likely work as the primary backup to Raheem Mostert this weekend.\nOCTOBER 19, 2023\n\u2022\nROTOWIRE\nTuesday Dolphins Mailbag: Fangio, Pass Rush, Wilson, and More\nWith the injuries at running back, is it the week that Jeff Wilson Jr. returns?

Wilson lived in the dumpster over the course of the yearlong project.[4]\nJupe[edit]\nIn 2020, Wilson launched Jupe, a flat-packed housing tech startup.[5]\nKasita[edit]\nKasita Exterior\nWilson was a Co-Founder and CEO at the startup company Kasita.[6][2][7] Kasita builds micro smart homes that are capable of stacking.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Kasita was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies[14] and won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award.[15] Wilson has referred to Kasita as a holistic integrated product, rather than a house.[16] In December 2018, Kasita was sold to a tiny house hotel company[17] in Austin, Texas.\nThe Dumpster Project[edit]\nProfessor Dumpster in front of a dumpster\nWilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)(3) non-profit 'The Dumpster Project',[18] a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home.[19] The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources.[20][21][22][23][24][25] The project won an HBCU Ford Corporation community sustainability grant[26] and a $10,000 Home Depot 'Retool Your School' competition,[27] but a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign was cancelled a few days before the deadline when it did not reach its goal.[28] The project has received its share of criticism, as commenters have likened the endeavor to \"poverty tourism\" and noted the self-promotional nature of Wilson's publicity.[29] On August 4, 2014, after six months without electricity, the project moved into the second phase, aiming to create what Wilson referred to as the 'Ultimate Studio Apartment'.[30] Though Wilson moved out of the dumpster in February 2015 short of accomplishing the goal of building a fully functioning home, it remains on the college campus where Wilson worked and has become a rotating space for teachers and educators.[31][32] On the first night of the new home school program, Austin's Blackshear Elementary Principal Betty Jenkins overnighted in the dumpster.[4][33] Wilson claims that the dumpster experiment was the central inspiration for Wilson's creation of the startup company, Kasita.[6]\n\"No Baggage\" experiment[edit]\nWilson and Bensen in No Baggage\nTogether with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' \"No Baggage\", in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website.[34][35][36] New Line Cinema has acquired the right to produce a feature film and hired Adam Brooks of Bridget Jones [37] to screen write the film based on a book[38] from Perseus Books entitled 'No Baggage' by Bensen.[39][40][41][42] American actress Shailene Woodley has been slated to play Bensen in the film.[43]\n99 Nights Couchsurfing experiment[edit]\nSubsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces.[4][44] The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.[45]\nAcademic Work[edit]\nWilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston\u2013Tillotson University in Austin, Texas.[1] He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury[46] and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States.[47] Wilson has authored numerous publications in the environmental science field and has received funding from the National Science Foundation.[48]\nReferences[edit]\n^\na b Wilson, Jeff. \"Jeff Wilson, Huston Tillotson\".
