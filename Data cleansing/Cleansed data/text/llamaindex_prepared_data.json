        "text": "In an experiment to see how much deprivation we could endure, Jeff and I set out on a journey with minimal planning and even less luggage. We were curious about whether we could enjoy the trip as much - or even more \u2014 when we eliminated the tourist agenda and most of the material trappings.\n\nWhat we discovered was that after a certain base level was met (water, food, shelter and a fully charged iPhone), decreasing the number of possessions did little to affect the quality of our journey. What we lost in souvenirs, we gained in unprecedented freedom of movement and an unbeatable conversation starter.\n\nWe didn't make it to Sarajevo by nightfall. We were dropped off at a rural Croatian border crossing where we walked across, papers in hand. Soon after we were picked up by a Sean Connery look-alike who informed us that he worked with wines. Wines turned out to be a mistaken translation of mines. We discovered the error when he parked his Subaru and walked us to a barbed-wire fence laced with warning signs that left no room for mistranslation.\n\nSobered by the minefield tour, we continued our journey south with a meditative tank driver named Igor, his name a literal remnant of the Soviet era. Igor put us on a bus to Sarajevo after an approaching wall of clouds clearly signaled the end of hitchhiking. From the rainy bus window we watched the pastoral fields of Croatia abruptly shift to the unearthly, shelled-out landscape of northern Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nThe bus waited until darkness had settled before repeatedly flat lining in the middle of the road. No one balked. In fact, the distinctive camaraderie of strangers emerged. Laughter rippled through the seats each time the lights flickered and the engine died. A round of cheers followed when the driver cranked it back to life.\n\nSurreptitious bottles of beer were passed from seat to seat and chocolates emerged from nowhere. I have no idea how we made it to Sarajevo, but I do know that that day embodied everything we set out to learn from our experiment.\n\nWe ended our journey after eight countries, 3,500 miles and 21 days in the same clothes. Our romantic relationship intact, Jeff and I boarded the Heathrow return flight as closer friends than ever (despite the questionable state of our undergarments). Materially speaking I was as empty-handed as the day we started, but I actually carried a great deal back home across the Atlantic.\n\nTraveling with no luggage and no plans was much more than a minimalist lesson in living well with less. It was an intense, in-your-face invitation to the unknown. There\u2019s a truly magnificent side to the unknown, but we aren\u2019t taught how to welcome it, let alone explore the breadth of its possibilities.\n\nDid our luggage-less dance with uncertainty lead to some kind of travel nirvana? Yes and no. We careered through time and space at a fiendish pace and experienced all the blood, sweat and exhaustion that might be expected. At the same time, we were vividly present in the midst of a disorienting cloud of city grids, metro stops and incomprehensible dialects that shape-shifted with every border crossing.\n\nWe were alive. And every so often the intensity was punctuated with time-crushing moments that were so staggeringly beautiful and strange that even now I\u2019m not sure they occurred at all.",

Adam Brooks (\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\") will adapt the story for the screen.",

I have a few things I dabble in, and I\u2019m going to push one of these experiments to the nth limit in June.\u201d She expressed an interest and the two travelled to eight different countries in 21 days, with just one outfit each and essentials like toothbrushes and passports in their possession.\n\nThe script will be written by Adam Brooks, whose credits include other examples of the genre such as Wimbledon, Definitely Maybe and French Kiss.\n\nIt follows news of Worst Tinder Date Ever, a romantic comedy in development about an accident-filled encounter between two people who meet on the dating app.\n\nWoodley will next be seen in Oliver Stone\u2019s Snowden, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt, before starring in the HBO series Big Little Lies with Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman.",

        "text": "HOME TRAILERS 2024 SCHEDULE 2025 SCHEDULE SHORT FILMS REVIEWS PODCAST INTERVIEWS NEWS FEEDS ABOUT US\nNew Line Going on 'The Craziest OkCupid Date Ever' for Three Weeks\n\nby Ethan Anderton\nMay 2, 2014\nSource: Variety\nWe've got a movie based on Peeps and a series of films somehow adapting the life advice blogs The Knot, The Bump and The Nest, and now it's time for a movie based on a date from Ok Cupid, the online dating website. However, we will say that the inspiration for the story does sound like it has the makings of a charming romantic comedy.\n\nVariety has word that New Line Cinema is looking to adapt Clare Benson's Salon.com article \"The Craziest Ok Cupid Date Ever\" for a feature film called No Baggage that will follow two online romancers who traveled through eight countries in three weeks without changing clothes.\n\nAs Benson explains, the date was pretty wild and majestic:\n\u201cWith no stuff, moving to the next destination was as simple as getting out of bed and pointing to a dot on the map,\u201d she said. \u201cWe jumped from city to city using almost every mode of transportation on earth: an old train along the Turkish coast, a giant ferry across the Aegean, a cramped bus through the Balkans, a series of hitches through Croatia, a flight to Edinburgh and a pair of bikes in London.\u201d\n\nFor the date, no plans were made in advance. It was just two people who barely knew each other going off on a whirlwind adventure, flying by the seat of their pants. It's pretty inspiring actually, even though it's also rather dangerous.\n\nNew Line is working with Adam Shankman (director Hairspray and Rock of Ages) to produce the film through his Offspring Entertainment production banner (who are also behind the spiritual Mean Girls sequel Mean Moms). We're just glad this falls outside the realm of your typical romantic comedy, at least from a story standpoint. Now a script just needs to be written. Interested?",

I'm a reclusive writer who spends hours identifying new constellations in the ceiling paint. He can strike an insta-friendship with any human not in a coma. I often pretend I don't recognize people at the grocery store. Somehow our personality differences are offset by the fact that the same mad scientist blood flows through both of our veins. We live for the unexpected, the experimental and the subtly disruptive.\n\nNever one to waste time, Jeff set an experimental trap weeks before he knew my real last name or whether I actually looked like the pictures on OKCupid. He sent me a message saying he was an avid traveler with an obsession for trying new foods. This seemed like a pretty standard profile for someone I would avoid in a social situation.\n\nBut his profile picture of himself holding a giant turkey leg had caught my eye, and we exchanged several messages about our shared love of obscure cheeses and historical sites.\n\nAfter what felt like hours of exchanging witty banter, Jeff asked if I wanted to meet up in person. We agreed on a location, but as the date approached, Jeff informed me that he was actually going to be traveling to Italy for work, and would I like to join him?\n\nI hesitated for a moment before agreeing, mostly because I had nothing better to do, and also because Italy is an amazing place to go to for work.\n\nThe next thing I knew, we were booking flights and hotels at breakneck speed. Our first date turned into a three-day weekend, which then turned into a week, and so on.\n\nBefore I knew it, Jeff and I had been traveling together for 21 days, covering over 5,000 miles of Italian countryside.",

        "text": "The OkCupid Date That Turned Into A Round-The-World Trip Is Becoming A Rom-Com\n\nLast November, Salon writer Clara Bensen told a story that was as charming as it was slightly unbelievable, about the time that she and a random stranger that she\u2019d met on OkCupid decided to travel the world together. For her, it seemed like an incredibly bizarre risk, as this man who looked like he\u2019d just auditioned for a role in a Williamsburg production of Curious George could have been a really hip serial killer, for all she knew.\n\nNaturally, Bensen\u2019s wild adventure, which had her and Jeff traveling through eight countries over 21 days, all with only the clothes that they wore when they first met, drew the eyes of Hollywood execs who have developed romantic comedies from less. Sure enough, according to Variety, the story was optioned by New Line Cinema in April and now the studio has signed rom-com scribe Adam Brooks to bring us\u2026 get ready for it\u2026 No Baggage.\n\nWhen tired we surfed on couches, floors, park lawns and a real bed or two. When hungry we grazed on street food, cafe fare and the occasional home-cooked meal. When curious we drifted in and out of crowded bazaars, empty churches, political protests, and ancient ruins. When washing our clothes we wore scarf togas, bed sheets, towels and borrowed T-shirts.\n\nAfter a few days of wearing the same dress I realized that my initial fears of dire uncleanliness were unfounded. Soap is a fairly universal concept. If I was dirty, I took a shower wherever we were staying. If my dress began to smell a little earthy, I washed it in a sink or a washing machine before I went to sleep. It was really that simple.\n\nNeither Jeff nor I wanted an around-the-world adventure in suffering. We like to eat, sleep and travel well \u2014 just like everyone else. Many people interpreted our experiment as a radical act (\u00e0 la John the Baptist\u2019s honey and crickets survival diet), but it truly wasn\u2019t designed to test how much deprivation we could endure.\n\nWe were curious about whether we could enjoy a journey just as much \u2014 or even more \u2014 when we eliminated the tourist agenda and most of the material trappings. What we discovered was that after a certain base level was met (water, food, shelter and a fully charged iPhone), decreasing the number of possessions did little to affect the quality of our journey.\n\nWhat we lost in souvenirs, we gained in unprecedented freedom of movement and an unbeatable conversation starter.",

        "text": "The Love Story Behind That Crazy OkCupid Date\nNOVEMBER 17, 2013, 6:15 AM\n\nRemember that obscenely romantic story about the craziest OkCupid date ever, from earlier this week? The one that made your heart hurt and your brain feel strange things? Well, we've got a little more info.\n\nThe story Clara Bensen originally posted on Salon was mostly about her and Jeff's trip around the world, but The Expeditioner correctly guessed that we were hankering for more details on the relationship behind it all. Bensen opened up on the subject, and of course, it's every bit as whimsical as you'd expect.\n\nFor the record, they had met before they embarked on the trip together. This is how it happened, if you can believe it: \"The first time Jeff and I arranged to meet in person, he gave me a set of geographical coordinates and told me to meet him at exactly 7:52 p.m. The coordinates turned out to be a blue-tiled star right under the giant marble dome of the Texas State Capitol building. 7:52 p.m. was sunset. The word \u201csubtle\u201d has never been in his vocabulary.\"\n\nSeriously, someone needs to make this into a movie right now. Immediately. We might just close down operations at R29 and turn the place into a movie studio just for this \u2014 that's how intensely rom-com-able it is.\n\nOf course, that's not all there is to it. While she admits that the draw to the story was largely the OkCupid hook, for Bensen, the reasoning behind their adventure was really to explore their relationship with material possessions. \"Some commenters have pointed out that millions of people in the world live with very few belongings and it was no big achievement for us to have gone luggage-less for a few weeks. That is a completely valid point and we wouldn\u2019t deny it,\" she explains.\n\n\"Still, as an American living in a culture that places a high value on consumption and accumulating stuff, it felt personally meaningful to explore my dependency on physical belongings within the context of travel.\" No kidding. As the saying goes, it's a lot easier to form a habit than it is to break one, and luxuriating in piles of mostly useless stuff is something many of us are all too guilty of.\n\nThis interview is every bit as worth reading as the original article, so please, do check it out. Oh, and in case you're wondering what happened to that green dress? \"I haven\u2019t worn the green dress since the last day of the experiment. It\u2019s hanging in my closet as the only souvenir I brought back from the trip.\" (The Expeditioner)",

Having chatted for a little over a month, the two decided to embark on a very strange date \u2013 going travelling with no baggage, no planned accommodation and no itinerary.\n\nThe two flew to Istanbul for their 21 day date with just the clothes on their back and a few essentials, including a toothbrush, a map of Istanbul and their phones. \n\nAnd the story is being adapted for a new romantic comedy called No Baggage.

Davis\n\nWhat happens when \u201ca reclusive writer who spends hours identifying new constellations in the ceiling paint\u201d agrees to go on an OKCupid date with \u201ca wildly energetic university professor\u201d? Well, if they\u2019re two twentysomethings who share an overly robust sense of whimsy, the date turns into a spontaneous three-week trip around the world, which turns into a Salon essay and then into a big-time Hollywood movie.\n\nVariety reports that Clara Bensen\u2019s essay \u201cThe Craziest OkCupid Date Ever\u201d is being adapted into a rom-com called No Baggage. The movie sounds like the final nail in the genre\u2019s coffin, but at the very least this means our crappy OKCupid dates have the potential to become something more than a pile of misery.\n\nHey, Hollywood: My craziest OKCupid date was when the guy said he was five foot eight but turned out to be five foot two. I left after two-thirds of a drink and went home and ate a pint of ice cream even though I\u2019m lactose intolerant. Get at me.",

These strangers' whirlwind tour of Europe wasn't your standard dinner-and-movie date.\n\nWOULD you travel around the world with someone you had just met, and with no possessions but the clothes on your back?\n\nThat's what Clara Bensen did.\n\nThe young American writer met Jeff, a university professor, three months ago via the online dating website OkCupid, she reveals in an op-ed piece on Salon.\n\nBut as they got chatting online, Jeff revealed his fondness for travel and invited Clara on his next trip. Though he's not your average holiday-maker.\n\nJeff would book an outgoing flight overseas and a flight back home out of another city a few countries away - without an itinerary or any plans to speak of. And his latest experiment? Bringing nothing but the clothes on his back.\n\nClara was initially sceptical. \"I'm not gonna lie: The thought of ultra-minimalist travel was initially disturbing\".\n\nBut she couldn't help but feel intrigued by the idea.\n\n\"Even nightmares of unkempt leg hair couldn't completely banish the thought. What would it be like to say no to heavy backpacks full of coordinating outfits, Lonely Planet travel guides, and cheap souvenirs?\"\n\nAnd so six weeks after meeting, the pair nervously booked two flights (luggage not included) to Istanbul.\n\nThe few items they did take included: passports, credit cards, iPhones, a small notebook, a toothbrush, a map, an iPad mini and some toiletries.\n\nTheir journey began in Istanbul and from there they zigzagged wildly across Europe. The pair travelled city to city, via whatever means they came across.\n\n\"There were no plans. With no stuff, moving to the next destination was as simple as getting out of bed and pointing to a dot on the map,\" she wrote on Salon.\n\nClara and Jeff made their way surfing on couches, eating street food and visiting tourist hot spots. And they managed to find a way around the whole one-outfit issue.\n\n\"After a few days of wearing the same dress I realised that my initial fears of dire uncleanliness were unfounded,\" Clara wrote.\n\nThe pair visited eight countries over 21 days, experiencing cultures they would have never encountered before.\n\nTheir travel odyssey ended with Jeff flying home from Barcelona and Clara returning to the US via Rome.",

        "text": "The Portal Pairs Circular Waste Technology and High Design\n\nAn off-grid toilet developed by Jeff Wilson's Jupe; the Portal aims to revolutionize the porta-potty experience.\n\nPorta-potty experience, or PPX, as Jupe CEO Jeff Wilson has coined it, isn\u2019t something most people spend much time thinking about. For Wilson, who is known for his out-of-the-box companies and sustainability experiments (He founded award-winning modular housing company, Kasita, and once lived in a dumpster as a minimalist housing study) creating unique, mind-bending solutions is something he can\u2019t resist. So, it\u2019s no wonder that his latest innovation not only blends eco-friendly design with techy additions but proposes an aesthetic alternative to its function-first predecessor.\n\nThe Jupe team, which includes former Tesla and SpaceX designers and engineers, aims to create spaces with packetized infrastructure that are light on the land. Jupe\u2019s latest launch, The Portal, is a state-of-the-art portable toilet, a fully off-grid and packable structure that can be used for events, festivals, camping, and more, is a logical next step to its popular sleeping unit. Furthermore, The Portal can be set up anywhere porta-potties are allowed without the hassle of permitting.\n\nDrawing inspiration from 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, as well as the impressive, austere works of Donald Judd and James Turrell, the space-age Portal features a renewable Douglas Fir frame with mirrored exterior wrapping, solar power, an always-on fan, skylight, and three times the interior space of a traditional outdoor toilet. Wilson and his team even went to Burning Man for direct user feedback, taking complaints of the dark, knee-bumping experience and left vowing to do better. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the smell,\u201d Wilson explains. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to turn around, manipulate clothing off and on, or even stand up.\u201d\n\nIn lieu of the cramped experience, the Jupe designers wanted heeding the call of Mother Nature to be a radically different experience. \u201cAspirational and porta-potty aren\u2019t two words you\u2019d ever expect to hear in the same sentence,\u201d the company\u2019s founder remarks.\n\nWhile the first Portals are currently in production and readying to ship, a tester unit in the redwood forests an 80-minute drive north of Santa Cruz, California, has made quite the unexpected impact. \u201cPeople are unsure what it is,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cIs it a time machine, spaceship, or a weird monolith? No one guessed there was a toilet in there. There\u2019s nothing in the world that looks anything like it.\u201d Users step inside to welcoming LED track lighting, two-way glass, a pull-down screen, crisp interior, and canopy views. The Portal offers a design-forward alternative to rows of plastic toilets at concerts, parks, and campgrounds, but Wilson wants to take things a step further, pairing the Portal with his company\u2019s tiny home business to offer a complete kit for off-grid living.\n\nMORE FROM METROPOLIS\n\u2018We\u2019re working with Wasted*, a Vermont-based sanitation company, as our composting partner and will be integrating their proprietary circular-waste transformation technology, so what is produced will be returned to the Earth safely as fertilizer,\u201d he says. Wilson expects the Earth Portal, a version with built in composting tech, to be available for purchase by end-of-year. it could be a game-changer for off-gridders looking to step up their sustainability game.",

        "text": "This $12M/yr Glamping Business\nIn 2020, Jeff Wilson founded Jupe with the mission of solving the global housing crisis and this year his company is set to do $12 million in revenue.\n\nWilson sells and rents Jupes, tent-like tiny homes with the luxuries of modern living. These tiny homes can be quickly shipped and set up anywhere around the country to offer a premium glamping experience complete with heating, cooling, a comfortable queen-sized mattress, and solar-powered outlets.\n\nWilson sells these tiny homes for $30k outright. However, property owners with a scenic plot of land who are interested in hosting can get their hands on Jupes for free. Here\u2019s how that works:\n\nJupe takes 30-50% of the rental revenue\nJupe rents for $250-$500 a night\nAnd the Jupe team will manage the entire rental process: the installation, repairs, bookings, etc.\nJupe reservations are made through platforms like Airbnb and Glamping hub.\n\nThere are three main reasons why Jupe is such a success:\n1. They Picked The Right Trends\nWhen the pandemic hit in March of 2020, the hospitality industry took a massive downturn, but one niche soared into prominence: glamping.\nJupe launched in April 2020 and offered attractive nature vacations for urban residents looking to escape city living. In its first year, Jupe made an impressive $7 million in revenue.\n\n2. They Monetize An Underutilized Asset\nJupe is designed to be completely self-sufficient and operate off the grid. The MVP product is a solar-powered tent structure that pops up in a few hours, anywhere, and the software to find your happy place in nature.\nMeaning any landowner with a few extra acres can spin up a Jupe tent without the need for plumbing or any infrastructure.\n\n3. They're A Risk-Free 'Done For You' Solution\nJupes' \"just add land\" option means that landowners can generate extra revenue from unused land with no additional headaches. Jupe will set up and operate the business and landowners just collect checks at the end of the month.",

His work on sustainability and minimalism has been covered broadly by publications like Forbes, The Atlantic, NY Times, and The Washington Post.\n\n\nJeff talked to us about his \u201cDumpster Project\u201d as well as his previous and current startup ventures. As an entrepreneur, Jeff has founded and built a micro housing startup, Kasita, that was sold off in 2018. Jeff\u2019s latest company Jupe, has been a part of the recent Y Combinator batch, and Jeff also highlights what he learned from that experience.\n\n\nIn our conversation with Jeff we also discuss the details of how his current product works, the challenges of building a hardware company, picking the right co-founder, and\u2026 fundraising at the urinals.\nEpisode transcript\nGreg Miaskiewicz:\nSo, we'd like to talk about the very beginning stories on Startup Foundations. So how did you first become an entrepreneur? How did you get interested in big business startups, high-intensity interval capitalism?\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nI like that term. Is there an acronym?\n\n\nGreg Miaskiewicz: It's HIIC.\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nHIIC. Well, I'm a sixth generation Texan.\n\n\nGreg Miaskiewicz: Natural born HIIC.\n\n\nJeff Wilson:\nSo it's a weird story. I've been an environmental science professor, a tenured professor. Safest job in the world. I decided I wanted to do this experiment around minimal living and around waste. So I convinced the university administration, to let me live in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year. An actual used trash dumpster and convert into a home. When you have aspirations as a professor of being part of the 1%, it's probably going to have nothing to do with wealth.\n\n\nSo I just went with, I'll live in 1% the volume of the average American home, own 1% of the stuff and consume 1% of the energy and water.\nSo did this and began moving my little dumpster house around the city and playing with coding officials and planning and learning how to design small spaces. And at one point, as you're laying in your dumpster at night, looking up at the heavens through the roof, this idea came to me of making the iPhone of housing. An integrated piece of hardware and software.\n\n\nOf course, there's an iPhone at Tesla and Uber and everything I learned later. But it seemed like a good\nenough idea. I moved out of the dumpster, raised my first check and started a company called Kasita.\n\nGreg Miaskiewicz:\nHow did you first become an entrepreneur?\nJeff Wilson:\nI'm a sixth generation Texan...",

I'm actually one of those I pack up and I move. And I've done this. I've lived in seven countries. I've lived all over, and so I've never had really any material ties whatsoever. I think the one thing that I've carried with me through the countries is the tapestry from South Africa, like a big giraffe and I always put it up, but\u2026And then I'm pretty low-key.

We can tune into those guys and see if the aliens can just send us any instructions to help on Jupe, and then we can support all of the folks getting off, like yourselves.

I'll just go in the order I have you on my screen. Natalie, do you want to start?\n\nNatalie Rens: Yeah. We're about to do a re-design, but go to the website. It has relatively most of the stuff on there. So, www.astrea.com. We tend to post a little bit more maybe on Instagram. We should probably do a little bit more of that. But yeah, I think just in general, if you're excited about sustainability or space, then yeah, reach out. And if there's any ways that we can help out or engage, we\u2019ll start to (00:38:25) that.\n\nJeff Wilson: Cool. Yeah. I would love to have folks come down and visit our site south of San Francisco in the redwoods. We have a secret mezcal bar there and a really cool bathroom, we call the portal, that looks more like a time machine. So, if anybody is coming out to the Bay Area, we rent that place out to groups. We\u2019re happy to give folks a tour. They can just reach out to me on Twitter @ProfDumpster or go to www.jupe.com and they can reach us there.\n\nJackson Steger: Great. We'll have to do this again over mezcals in the redwoods. Jeff, Natalie, thank you both so much for coming.",

For individual owners to set up Jupe in remote locations for COVID-safe getaways, and for rental hosts to add additional units to properties with high demand.\n\nTo see more:\nDiscover Kasita & discover Jeff Wilson\n\n\u201cJupe Overlooking Downtown Los Angeles\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: Sam Gezari\n\n\u201cThe desire to get out of the cities that we\u2019ve seen over the past decade and the acceleration of that trend during the pandemic has drained short-term stay inventory for those that want to experience nature,\u201d Wilson said in a statement, release in December. \u201cFurther, the recent success of the IPOs in this space and the off-the-charts demand to \u201cstay close\u201d make the timing for short-term stay products like Jupe impeccable.\u201d\n\nJupe is supported by interconnected and durable aluminum masts which make up its illuminated and distinct geometric shape. Its unique shape and angular surfaces resemble a cut diamond or an interstellar shuttle which embraces the beauty of its patina.\n\nPhoto credit: Sam Gezari\n\nEach unit features an 11-foot-high ceiling that allows users to comfortably occupy its 111-square-feet of interiors, cloaked in a high-quality, fire-resistant canvas and grounded by finished Baltic birch wood tile-flooring.\n\nPhoto credit: Jeff Wilson\n\nBeyond offering an ample interior, side windows heighten the sense of openness, providing cross-ventilation and natural light. The unit\u2019s front-facing facade opens up into a single large panoramic window to take in awe-inspiring wide angle views. Splashes of warm desert tones enliven a minimal aesthetic that merges contemporary and functional design.\n\nShipped as a flat-pack, the tent can be assembled in a few hours and are USD$17,500.\n\n\u201cExperiencing the natural wonders of the world shouldn\u2019t mean being forced to disconnect while staying in a less-than-inspirational living space,\u2019 comments Jeff Wilson, co-founder and CEO. \u201cJupe is an out-of-this-city getaway inspired by out-of-this-world ideas. During these times when most of us are craving a true escape, Jupe provides an experience perfectly suited for socially distanced travel.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: Sam Gezari\n\nABOUT JUPE\n\nJupe is a high-design prefab shelter technology company, building products enabling short-term travellers to escape into the wilds of nature while remaining plugged in. Founded by Jeff Wilson, a modular housing and design innovator, Jupe was designed and built by former SpaceX, Tesla, and AirBnB employees. Jupe\u2019s design is inspired by cosmic aesthetics with a comfortable, modern interior.",

And, he\u2019s offering them for free to anyone who will provide the land for rent (in exchange for splitting the rental income).\n\nThe Jupe units are fully off-grid and designed to ship flat-packed, enabling bulk deliveries of fifteen units on a single truck. \u201cArriving with all the essentials \u2018in the box\u2019\u2014including a luxury queen mattress and bed, furniture, LED lighting, solar panels and backup batteries, and even the linens\u2014Jupes assemble in a little over an hour and units are ready to rent the day they arrive,\u201d explains Wilson.\n\nDespite its canvas cladding Wilson calls it \u201cmore a device than a tent: Jupe\u2019s units are built on an innovative \u201cchassis\u201d foundation that gives them the flexibility to move quickly and freely, adapt to any terrain, and oftentimes forgo the necessity of building permits.\u201d This exoskeleton for housing allows for rapid assembly, and disassembly, requiring no foundation work, no platform, and no electrical utility drags, so \u201cpermits are rarely necessary\u201d.\n\nWilson says it wouldn\u2019t be hard to add SIPP panels or more conventional walls to make these adequate for longer-term living; currently they are ideal for not only short-term rentals, but as popup disaster relief shelter.\n\nOn the \u201cSlow Coast\u201d of California (north of Santa Cruz), Dr. Wallace Nichols lost his home to the 2020 CZU Lightning Complex fires and decided a big box of a house no longer makes sense and instead chose to purchase six Jupes for his 20-acre property that not only went up fast but could be moved fast in the event of another fire.\n\nJupe popup shelter tests Freemium for housing relief & stays.",

Soon, we hope to be able to fit 24 units. This would make it easier to get shelter to people in need faster.\n\nWhat does your base model cost and what does that pricing include?\n\nThe base model costs between $20,000 and $30,000. The shelter features an 11-foot ceiling, off-grid power, air conditioning, and dimmable LED track lighting alongside USB charging stations near the bed. The exterior is weather-resistant canvas, while the interior is made from Douglas fir.\n\nYou can add a solar package and a front porch\u2014which can also come with its own lighting\u2014which will measure 8-by-13 feet. A queen-sized mattress, frame, and headboard are also part of delivery, and everything is assembled in hours.\n\nA queen-sized frame, mattress, and headboard are included in the Jupe's standard features.\n\nWhat qualities make your prefab stand apart from the rest?\n\nI think what makes our prefab stand apart from the rest is its scalability. Right now we can make a Jupe in four hours, and we plan on being able to assemble one in just four minutes. Another detail that makes Jupe distinctive is its shipping efficiency. Our flat-pack model makes it possible to ship numerous Jupes at once, and we\u2019re in the process of developing a fleet model that can be deployed on shipping containers throughout the world.\n\nWhere is the prefab currently available?\n\nWe are currently available in North America.\n\n\"All you need to do is throw sheets on and you're ready to go,\"",

        "text": "Jupe Inc. is hoping these modular housing units can help hospitals address coronavirus capacity issues.\n\nBy Paul Thompson \u2013 Assistant Managing Editor, Austin Business Journal\nApr 2, 2020\n\nOn page 3 of our weekly edition we wrap up some of the news, talk and speculation floating around town with our Capital Gains feature. Here's what caught our eyes this week.\n\n'PROFESSOR DUMPSTER' ENTERS FIGHT AGAINST CORONAVIRUS\n\nJeff Wilson, founder of Austin-based Kasita, has launched a new venture that produces rapid-deployment recovery spaces for frontline health care workers and those needing to quarantine due to COVID-19.\n\nJeff Wilson earned the nickname Professor Dumpster when he was on the faculty at Huston-Tillotson University and spent a year living in a converted dumpster to test the limits of housing design and sustainability. He later founded Kasita, once a buzzy Austin company that produced tiny homes, though it was reborn in 2019 under a new ownership group as a company that makes luxury hotel suites. At the time, the restructured Kasita's website said \"there was not enough consumer demand to support their plan to manufacture and sell tiny homes directly to consumers,\" leading Kasita in its original form to cease operations.\n\nWilson's new company, New York-based Jupe Inc., bills itself as a \"flat-packed housing startup built for crisis and disaster response,\" according to a March 26 announcement. Its latest product, Jupe Health, is designed to help hospitals deal with capacity issues in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The units are \"equipped with mobile bedding, technology, and amenities to support long-term containment efforts,\" according to the announcement.\n\n\u201cThe significant shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), equipment \u2014 like ventilators \u2014 combined with the massive cost of quickly building the infrastructure and managing a hospital bedroom, which is about $1 million per unit all-in, is a massive undertaking. Hospitals can\u2019t tackle it all rapidly enough, even once the federal government\u2019s aid package kicks in,\u201d said Dr. Esther Choo, chief medical advisor to Jupe Health.",

Designed by Jeff Wilson, a micro-habitat expert, these tents are destined to win over a new generation of nomads. The kind of people who make the outside world their home and live with the bare necessities. These people will now be able to set up their tent wherever they like without giving up on much appreciated comfort.\n\nJUPE is designed with upcycled materials integrating photovoltaic cells, it unfolds in just a few minutes, and includes a large-size bed. This new way of discovering new places will surely be one of the great trends of the years to come. Available this Spring, JUPE will be sold for \u20ac15,000.",

        "text": "These tiny $17,500 prefab 'urban escape pods' from former Tesla and SpaceX designers will ship this spring.\n\nTiny-living startup Jupe released new images of its sci-fi inspired portable shelters, or \"cosmos-inspired urban escape pods,\" late last year, and they're now available to preorder.\n\nThe company was founded by Jeff Wilson, an ex-IBM project manager known for living in a dumpster for a year and later creating the Kasita tiny home. With designers from Tesla, SpaceX, and Airbnb, Jupe is a portable prefab shelter that can go just about anywhere. Individual owners can bring their Jupe to remote locations for COVID-safe getaways, or Airbnb hosts could add additional units to properties with high demand.\n\n\"The desire to get out of the cities that we've seen over the past decade and the acceleration of that trend during the pandemic has drained short-term stay inventory for those that want to experience nature,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Further, the recent success of the IPOs in this space and the off-the-charts demand to 'stay close' make the timing for short-term stay products like Jupe impeccable.\"\n\nJupe is available for preorder for $99, with a total cost of $17,500. The company notes that the price is only about a fifth of the price of an average Airstream RV. Jupe will produce the units at its 10,000 square foot Los Angeles factory, beginning to fulfill orders by March.\n\nJupe is made of interconnected aluminum masts that provide support for the geometric shape that's designed to be reminiscent of an \"interstellar shuttle.\" The sides are made of fire-resistant canvas, while the floor is wood tiling. Though it's only 111 square feet inside, Jupe feels surprisingly roomy, with 11 foot-tall ceilings.\n\nThe floor also opens up into storage cubes, totaling more than 38 cubic feet of storage space. Each unit comes with solar panels, a 200 Ah battery system, and WiFi router, with the option to add on dimmable LED lighting and a Sonos speaker with Alexa.\n\nThe Jupe can be flat-packed down onto the base frame for easy transportation. It can be reassembled anywhere, even off the grid, thanks to solar power and batteries.",

        "text": "Welcome to The Proper Tea! In this issue, we're excited to introduce you to a stellar startup that's set to revolutionize the housing market: Jupe.\n\nMeet the dynamic duo behind Jupe Inc., Jeff Wilson and Antonio Gonzalez. These two ambitious founders have embarked on a mission to transform the way we live by offering affordable, off-grid housing solutions. Did you know that Wilson once lived in a 33 sq ft dumpster for a year as part of The Dumpster Project? Talk about dedication to minimalistic living!\n\nJupe's stylish shelters are inspired by space habitats and offer a modern, sustainable twist on traditional campers. Each unit is crafted from lightweight aluminum and comes fully equipped with all the amenities you need for a comfortable off-grid experience. As we face a worldwide housing crisis, Jupe's inventive approach offers a unique solution that could change the way we live and interact with our environment.\n\nTheir portable, eco-friendly homes are both accessible and affordable, making a real impact in addressing the issue. The cutting-edge technology in Jupe's shelters is powered by solar energy and provides 7 days of battery storage. Each shelter boasts a queen-sized bed, storage, desk, and more. Plus, they come with smart home technology to make your off-grid living even more seamless and enjoyable.\n\nAfter raising approximately $1M in pre-seed funding and $3M during YC Demo Day, Jupe closed an additional $4.5M seed round led by Initialized Capital in late 2021, bringing their total funding to $9.5M. This investment will help them scale production, expand their team, and reach more people seeking sustainable living options.\n\nJupe is tapping into the growing demand for flexible, off-grid living options. Remote work, eco-tourism, and the tiny home movement all contribute to the appeal of their product. Additionally, Jupe's shelters have the potential to be a game-changer for disaster relief and refugee housing.\n\nWith a mission to democratize access to affordable, sustainable, and beautiful housing, Jupe has a bright future ahead. As they continue to scale, they'll focus on improving design, tech integration, and sustainability. Keep an eye on this startup as they reshape the way we think about housing.",

        "text": "Camping in Style: The Jupe Pod and the Bowlus Terra Firma Featured in Journal #369\n\nGone are the days of plain old tents and RVs, as new ways to camp are featured in Journal #369 that redefine the term glamping.\n\nThe first product featured is the Jupe pod (above). Created by Cameron Blizzard, Jeff Wilson, and a team that included former employees of Tesla and SpaceX, the Jupe pod is a sustainable, compact, collapsible cabin that\u2019s adaptable to most terrain and leaves the ground and surroundings undisturbed while providing its inhabitants a great view with lots of privacy. Not only can it easily fit in the trunk of your car, but it can be assembled in only a few hours.\n\nAt 111 square feet with an 11-foot ceiling, there\u2019s plenty of space, and anyone is able to walk upright in the pod. The Jupe pod can fit a queen-size mattress and two end tables, and the unit also has hidden storage cubbies and a front-facing fa\u00e7ade that can open into a panoramic window. Staying in the Jupe pod does not prevent anyone from using electronics as it has solar energy and battery-powered electrical outlets and USB ports that provide excellent Wi-Fi access. Although it\u2019s not on the market yet, you can visit their website to preorder yours for $17,500.\n\nIf you want to travel in something more luxurious and spacious than the Jupe pod, the Bowlus Terra Firma camper may be perfect for you (above). The Terra Firma has overhead skylights, a Zen master bedroom, and an outdoor kitchen setup. It also has HEPA air filters, UVC lighting, and a water filtration system. Pets are not forgotten as the Terra Firma is equipped with a pull-out food tray for dogs (or cats). All of these amenities are powered by a lithium-iron-phosphate that can be managed through touchscreen controls.\n\nThe company Bowlus is named after Hawley Bowlus who was an aircraft engineer known for building Charles Lindbergh\u2019s Spirit of St. Louis in 1927. Bowlus soon after built his first trailer in 1934 to help transport flight crews to remote takeoff locations. Since then, the company has continued to produce the best in traveler trailers. Their trailers range from $190,000 to $265,000, with the Terra Firma being at the highest end of the spectrum.\n\nIf the Terra Firma appeals to you, but you can\u2019t afford the price, it\u2019s worth looking into trailers made by Airstream, a company that was inspired by Bowlus. Airstream has six different models to choose from that range from $39,500 to $161,900 and has gotten great reviews, including some from celebrity customers like Matthew McConaughey and Ralph Lauren.\n\nTo learn more about the Jupe pod and the Bowlus Terra Firma, and Airstream trailers, purchase Journal #369 at graphis.com.",

        "text": "Housing Technology Company Jupe Raises $9.5 Million In Seed Funding\n\nBy Noah Long \u2022 Dec 22, 2021\n\nHousing technology startup Jupe recently announced $9.5 million in seed funding. The funding was led by Initialized Capital with participation from Y Combinator.\n\nThe funding will be used to hire a CTO and a wider team of software and hard tech engineers and to execute its mission to make off-grid mobile living more affordable, faster, and efficient.\n\nSince launching in December 2020, Jupe made and shipped dozens of units to locations across California and Colorado. And Jupe is on a mission to make beautiful and dignified shelter instantly deployable onto any accessible piece of land.\n\nJupe\u2019s technology essentially allows an entire village of units to be deployed and broken down on remote terrain in a single day. Designed with flexibility and customization in mind, Jupes can redeploy and pop-up anywhere from music festivals to natural disaster areas for relief housing, and provide a fast alternative to any other kind of shelter and infrastructure for living.\n\nJupes are built on a unique \u201cchassis\u201d foundation \u2014 which gives them the flexibility to move quickly and freely and adapt to any terrain. And 15 fully off-grid, flat-packed units can be delivered on a single truck. Each unit arrives complete with a luxury queen mattress, linens and bed, furniture, LED lighting, solar panels, and backup batteries. Jupes assemble in just over an hour and units are ready to rent the day they arrive.\n\nThrough a short-stay-as-service (SSAAS) land partner program, landowners can activate their space via a software booking platform and install a village of Jupes. And Jupe will deliver, install, book, maintain and clean the units, while the landowner receives a portion of every night\u2019s rental.\n\nThe forthcoming SSAAS software platform will also help landowners manage, market, and book their inventory via other short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, Hipcamp, and booking.com.\n\nCEO Dr. Jeff Wilson, a former environmental science professor, spent a year living in a dumpster as a small space sustainability experiment. Wilson went on to found Kasita, an award-winning modular housing company that deployed accessory dwelling units (ADU) to backyards in California and Texas.\n\nAnd co-founder and COO Antonio Gonzalez, a former executive at unicorn hospitality startup OYO, also previously led a $100 million sprinter van conversion business while serving as a Presidentially appointed advisory board to the National Park Service. The early and current members of Jupe\u2019s team engineered structures on SpaceX\u2019s starship, designed solar panels and cars for Tesla, designed large cargo drones, founded travel app companies, and helped steer the brand at Airbnb.\n\n\u201cModular construction is plagued with challenges around design, materials, and transport efficiency. I designed Jupe through learning what really works and what doesn\u2019t. Beyond creating a solution that scales the $4 billion glamping market, Jupe is a step forward in solving the housing crisis that impacts 1.6 billion people annually. Jupe units are ten times cheaper and faster to deploy than traditional temporary, mobile housing solutions, and ship 15 times more efficiently. On top of that, its unique design provides dignified lodging for everyone \u2013 with an internet connection.\u201d\n\n\u2014 CEO Dr. Jeff Wilson, former co-founder of award-winning modular maker Kasita\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to partner with Jeff and the team at Jupe. They are building a first-of-its-kind hard tech and software platform for the world. Jupe\u2019s vision of universal autonomous housing will ultimately allow anyone to live anywhere on the planet, comfortably and with an internet connection via satellite. It\u2019s something the world has been waiting for.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Initialized Capital founder and managing partner, Garry Tan",

        "text": "What the Hell Is a Jupe Off-Grid Dwelling?\n\nWritten by Andrew Marshall Dec 09, 2021 3:26 p.m. ET\n\nBasically, the Jupe is a fancy, solar-powered yurt. But there\u2019s so much more to it than that.\n\nFor one thing, Jupe was engineered by designers from SpaceX and Tesla. Those design chops shine through in the aesthetics. For starters, the interior has a clean, minimalist look finished in birch, canvas, and aluminum. The exterior architecture is somewhere between a shipping container and a spaceship.\n\n(Photo/Jupe)\n\nComfort on Delivery\nJupe is designed to be livable upon delivery, so the unit ships with a queen mattress, bed frame with headboard, and a deck. Jupe doesn\u2019t need a foundation, so in most places that means it doesn\u2019t need a permit.\n\nAs a final touch, Jupe contains USB charging stations and outlets, and purchasers can add an optional porch, smart speaker, solar package, and exterior LED lighting.\n\n(Photo/Jupe)\n\nJupe (the company as opposed to the product) has an interesting business model, seemingly targeting people with 1) land and 2) an interest in breaking into the short-term rental game in a serious way.\n\nJupe partners with purchasers to drop off the units and help with renting and booking. The minimum number you can order is eight, so you do need lots of land and a lot of interest.\n\nPrices and partnership details are available upon request from Jupe\u2019s website. You can also book a stay in a Jupe in California, Colorado, or Texas.\n\nHidden Depths\nAll of this information is pretty much what\u2019s on the (somewhat sparse) website. But TechCrunch just interviewed Jupe\u2019s founder, Jeff Wilson, and the article reveals some surprising purpose behind the slick lifestyle photos and startup-standard web copy.\n\nApparently, Wilson envisions Jupe as a solution to the global housing crisis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not making fucking glamping tents for bros at Coachella,\u201d Wilson told TechCrunch in the interview. \u201cAt this point, food is a distribution problem, clothing is largely solved. There are about 1.5 billion people in the world that still don\u2019t have adequate shelter. If you\u2019re going to work on big problems here on earth, that\u2019s one worth working on.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s enough of a dream to catch the attention of the Y Combinator, which TechCrunch is reporting just invested $9.5 million in the startup.\n\nWilson goes on to admit that the current iteration of Jupe isn\u2019t quite there yet:\n\n\u201cFor right now, it\u2019s someone that wants to have a very high-design, very comfortable experience in nature, off-grid. Longer-term as we build out the technology, we will build for people that no longer want to live in the cities, that want to live with a community of folks out on a raw piece of land. From there we expect to widen that time horizon to where people are living in these for weeks, months, ultimately their entire life.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a big dream and a worthy goal. We\u2019ll have to wait and see where Wilson and Jupe go from here.\n\nAndrew Marshall is a writer, illustrator, and photographer living and adventuring in the Smoky Mountains.

        "text": "DESIGNED BY FORMER SPACEX, TESLA, & AIRBNB EMPLOYEES, THIS FLATPACK SHELTER IS THE ULTIMATE ADVENTURE ESSENTIAL!\n\nGlamping pods are cool but what if I tell you there is a portable shelter literally designed by the best in the game? Jupe is a luxe pod with a sci-fi-inspired design made by a team of multidisciplinary experts from across the housing, architecture, and engineering industries, including former SpaceX, Tesla, and AirBnB team members for modern travelers looking to escape their urban life and dive into nature. The glowing geometric structure and angular surfaces resemble a cut diamond or an interstellar shuttle more than age-old structures like RVs, cabins, tents, or yurts traditionally used for getaways.\n\nJupe is a portable off-grid shelter that flatpacks so you can pick any spot on the planet and pitch your tent. The futuristic silhouette is inspired by Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: Space Odyssey which explains the aluminum pole frame and glowing Firesist fabric exterior which also make it suitable to withstand different climate conditions. The mission was not to make a quick place to stay but to create a gateway to the outside world. It can be assembled in hours and gives you a 111-square foot space featuring tall ceilings, finished Baltic birch wood floors, a queen bed, and a storage area \u2013 think something right in the middle of a tiny home and glamping pod.\n\nThe large entryway doubles up as a window for your chosen scenery which you can endlessly gaze at from your queen-sized bed. The shelter also includes a 200 amp hour battery and solar array with electrical outlets, USB charging stations, dimmable LED lighting system, and a private wi-fi network if you cannot be completely off the grid. Apart from the bed, it is also furnished with designer pieces like the end tables, a desk + chair, an ottoman, and an average-sized monolith to stay aligned with the cosmos theme. Unlike most small portable shelters, Jupe\u2019s ceilings are 11 feet tall and cloaked in luminous Firesist fabric. Like most tiny homes Jupe also optimizes its space \u2013 the Baltic birch wood floors open up to individual storage cubbies totaling 38 cubic feet which is enough space to store ten large suitcases (in case you are on the run).\n\n\u201cExperiencing the natural wonders of the world shouldn\u2019t mean being forced to disconnect while staying in a less-than-inspirational living space,\u201d said Jeff Wilson, co-founder and CEO of Jupe. \u201cJupe is an out-of-this-city getaway inspired by out-of-this-world ideas. During these times when most of us are craving a true escape, Jupe provides an experience perfectly suited for socially distanced travel.\u201d The interior was designed in collaboration with renowned boutique hotelier Liz Lambert and sustainable architecture expert, TED Prize Winner, and former head of social innovation at AirBnB, Cameron Sinclair. Wilson, a design innovator and expert on modular housing, himself has lived in a 33-square-foot dwelling for a year and is known for founding the award-winning, micro-home Kasita.\n\nMobility is at the core of Jupe\u2019s design and hence chassis foundation has been created in a way that involves no decking or foundation to be built which makes the shelter adaptable to any terrain, level or not, and leaves the land minimally disturbed. Amenities in the shelter can be upgraded include a Sonos Move speaker integrated with Alexa capabilities, a locking safe, solar panels, and a porch. Jupe is an off-grid escape from the city, whether to the middle of a sprawling desert, a windswept cliff by the sea, or your own backyard.\n\nDesigner: Jeff Wilson",

It last sent signals to Jupiter from the moon. It seems that a few of those blueprints were bounced back to Earth. We intercepted them and created Jupe.\"\n\nIf you're wiling to spend a little more, you can deck out your Jupe with smart speakers, a locking safe, and even solar panels for the full off-the-grid experience.\n\nJupes can be pre-ordered for a refundable $99 deposit.",

        "text": "Tiny-living startup Jupe just released new images of its sci-fi inspired portable shelters, or \"cosmos-inspired urban escape pods,\" which are now available to preorder.\n\nThe company was founded by Jeff Wilson, an ex-IBM project manager known for living in a dumpster for a year and later creating the Kasita tiny home. With designers from Tesla, SpaceX, and Airbnb, Jupe is a portable prefab shelter that can go just about anywhere. Individual owners can bring their Jupe to remote locations for COVID-safe getaways, or Airbnb hosts could add additional units to properties with high demand.\n\n\"The desire to get out of the cities that we've seen over the past decade and the acceleration of that trend during the pandemic has drained short-term stay inventory for those that want to experience nature,\" Wilson said in a statement. \"Further, the recent success of the IPOs in this space and the off-the-charts demand to 'stay close' make the timing for short-term stay products like Jupe impeccable.\"\n\nJupe is now available for preorder for $99, with a total cost of $17,500. The company notes that the price is only about a fifth of the price of an average Airstream RV. Jupe will produce the units at its 10,000 square foot Los Angeles factory, beginning to fulfill orders by March 2021.\n\nJupe is made of interconnected aluminum masts that provide support for the geometric shape that's designed to be reminiscent of an \"interstellar shuttle.\" The sides are made of fire-resistant canvas, while the floor is wood tiling. Though it's only 111 square feet inside, Jupe feels surprisingly roomy, with 11 foot-tall ceilings.\n\nThere's enough room for a queen-size bed, a desk, chair, and ottoman. The floor also opens up into storage cubes, totaling more than 38 cubic feet of storage space. The front window can open into a large panorama to take in views.\n\nEach unit comes with solar panels, a 200 Ah battery system, and WiFi router, with the option to add on dimmable LED lighting and a Sonos speaker with Alexa. The Jupe can be flat-packed down onto the base frame for easy transportation and reassembled anywhere, even off the grid, thanks to solar power and batteries.",

        "text": "Jupe designs flat-pack intensive care unit to bolster hospitals impacted by coronavirus\n\nEleanor Gibson | 27 March 2020\n\nFlat-pack startup Jupe has unveiled the \"world's first standalone intensive care unit\" and several other pop-up care facilities to help hospitals under pressure due to coronavirus.\n\nJupe, which was founded by entrepreneur Jeff Wilson and investment banker Cameron Blizzard to provide housing to displaced people, announced yesterday it was pivoting services in response to the pandemic.\n\nWilson and Blizzard teamed up with health advocate and physician Esther Choo and humanitarian designer Cameron Sinclair to develop the new arm called Jupe Health. It has created three care facilities that can be flat-packed and rapidly deployed to hospitals in the US.\n\n\"Hospitals can't tackle it all rapidly enough, even once the federal government's aid package kicks in,\" said Choo.\n\n\"The health system has many overlapping needs right now, and cannot function well without all the pieces in place,\" she continued. \"We're working to plug one of the more complex gaps.\"\n\nJupe Care is an off-grid recovery unit designed for patients that aren't critical\n\nThe facilities include Jupe Plus, a \"light\" intensive care unit (ICU); Jupe Care, an off-grid recovery unit for patients who aren't critical; and the Jupe Rest area that provides beds for medical professionals.\n\nJupe said it could deploy 24 of the flat-packed units on a heavy-duty pick-up truck with a 40-foot (12-metre) flatbed, or 500,000 on a single cargo ship, to both rural and urban areas in America.\n\n\"Having highly deployable recovery units gives us the best chance of fighting Covid-19 and to support our frontline medical professionals,\" Sinclair said.\n\nJupe Rest is intended to provide a place for medical professionals to sleep between shifts\n\nJupe has already started prototyping its Care and Rest Units. More details about Jupe Plus will be released next month, but the company says it will mark the \"world's first standalone intensive care unit\".\n\nJupe Rest units are designed to provide a place for medical professionals to sleep between shifts. It means that they don't need to travel back home, preventing contact with their families and avoiding spread of the Covid-19.\n\nRelated story\nCarlo Ratti Associati designs shipping-container intensive care units for coronavirus treatment\n\nEach comes with a bed and is connected to the Internet of Things, which refers to electronic objects that share data to provide a \"network-ready treatment space\" allowing air, climate and noise control.\n\nAlongside a bed, toilet, sink, and shower, Jupe Care units include ventilator hook-ups and separate chambers for medical professionals.\n\nJupe said it has been working with health experts to develop the facilities, which have been designed to meet the unique needs of patients during the pandemic.\n\n\"Hospitals are struggling to cope with the influx of patients due to the rapid spread of Covid-19,\" Wilson explained. \"We saw an opportunity to leverage our expertise in flat-pack construction and humanitarian design to help alleviate some of that pressure.\"\n\nJupe said it is working to deploy its facilities across America, starting with areas most severely affected by the pandemic.\n\n\"We're committed to doing everything we can to support healthcare professionals during this crisis,\" Wilson added. \"We're proud to be working alongside such a talented team of experts to develop these critical care facilities.\"",

Each Jupe unit is delivered as part of a chassis foundation that can be flat-packed to roam anywhere along with the onboard electrical grid. Two people can assemble the shelter in a few hours.\n\nJupe prefab shelter features one-of-its-kind modular chassis that houses wiring, electrical, and mechanical elements of a home into a flat packable foundation block. It is focused on modern travelers\u2019 who like to have a cozy home-like experience during trips. It works just like a tiny cabin perfect for short-term stays and even has modern facilities for a glamping experience.\n\nThis 111-square-foot tent is supported by aluminum masts and made using canvas. Its trapezoidal form and glowing frame are inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey. Inside, there is a queen-size bed, equipped with Nectar mattresses, a designer desk, chair, and ottoman. Baltic birch wood tile-flooring with plenty of storage makes the interiors more useful.\n\nJupe\u2019s clean interior was designed in collaboration with renowned boutique hotelier Liz Lambert (formerly Bunkhouse Hotels: El Cosmico, Phoenix Hotel) and sustainable architecture expert, TED Prize Winner, and former head of social innovation at AirBnB, Cameron Sinclair.\n\nJupe comes equipped with its own solar panel and 200 Ah battery system and Wi-Fi router, ensuring uninterrupted web connectivity for travelers. There are also options to include a Sonos Move speaker, a lock safe, a cooler, and a small porch.\n\nAlso Read: Boxabl Launches Casita Prefab Tiny Home That Sets Up in an Hour\n\nJupe units are now available for pre-order at a starting price of $17,500 through the official website. The first deliveries are slated for Spring 2021.",

        "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has brought many nations to their knees, but some individuals have been preparing for such an eventuality. Cameron Sinclair, a social impact entrepreneur and humanitarian designer, founded the non-profit Architecture For Humanity, which has experience in conflict and disaster zones.\n\nCameron Sinclair, chief humanitarian adviser of Jupe Health, recently revealed that his team had been designing and developing rapidly deployable modular care and COVID-19 recovery/isolation rooms for the past two weeks. These mobile treatment and isolation rooms are developed by a start-up company called Jupe Health, with Sinclair serving as chief humanitarian adviser.\n\nThe units come in three variations: Jupe Rest, Jupe Care, and Jupe Plus. Jupe Rest is a climate-controlled self-isolation room and rest/sleeping unit for medical professionals, accommodating a king, queen or two twin beds, featuring air-monitoring and noise-reduction technology, and easy to sanitize after use.\n\nJupe Care is an off-grid recovery unit for non-critical COVID-19 patients, incorporating a donning and doffing chamber, including a sink, toilet, and ventilator hookups, with hard- or soft-top cover options. Jupe Plus is billed as the world's first stand-alone micro-grid capable intensive care unit, intended to treat the severest cases.\n\nEach of the units has a 20-square-metre footprint and can be transported via truck, with up to 10 Care units connectable side by side to make a bigger treatment area. The Jupe team is currently testing these mobile units in California and Texas, aiming to deploy them in rural areas where resources are scarce.\n\nThe need for such rapidly deployable treatment facilities is expected to grow in North America, as the number of ICU rooms will be insufficient to handle the surge in COVID-19 cases.",

        "text": "Launched late last month, Jupe is a flatpack startup that has developed rapidly deployable, mobile medical shelters for rest, recovery and intensive care in combating the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe startup which is founded by Jeff Wilson (previously founded modular housing company Kasita) and Cameron Blizzard, is described as \u201c a coalition of veteran innovators across industries and professions including healthcare professionals, frontline ICU and ER doctors, architects, crisis response experts, auto designers, IOT experts, and modular building innovators.\u201d This multidisciplinary team has developed these mobile shelters which they claim can be produced at a little over 3% of the cost of a standard hospital room, and shipped anywhere using existing logistics infrastructure.\n\nOriginally intended to house the homeless or those affected by natural disasters, these shelters have been re purposed to be a solution for healthcare facilities need to quickly expand their number of beds. The Jupe mobile shelters come in three distinct versions,\n\nJupe Rest\nThe Rest unit is equipped with beds for providing a place to rest and sleep for medical professionals working on the front lines and can also serves as a micro self-isolation room. The unit can fit a Queen or two twin XL beds and is Wi-Fi/network and IOT-ready, as well as off-grid or micro-grid capable. It also features air monitoring and noise reducing technology, Climate control, and an optional integrated filtration system.\n\nJupe Care\nThe Care unit is an off-grid solar power/battery-powered solution for non-critical COVID-19 patients. It features a donning and doffing chamber, Ventilator hookups, Toilet / sink / heat & A/C. The unit is negative pressure capable and also integrates sanitary black-water disposal as well as easy-access external pump/monitoring.\n\nJupe Plus\nThe Jupe Plus is essentially a self-contained Intensive Care Unit for those patients that require critical care, including readings for use with ventilators and specialized personal protective equipment. The company is calling it the Worlds\u2019 First Stand-Alone Micro-Grid Capable Intensive Care Unit.\n\nIn terms of mobility, Jupe says that its solution can be flat-packed and stacked for transport of up to 24 units at a time on a 40-foot flatbed trailer, towed by a heavy-duty pickup truck. It says it can load as many as 500,000 on just one cargo container ship for overseas transport, too. They use a common base or \u201cchassis\u201d and readily available materials, and the company says that one person can install a single unit in just \u201cminutes.\u201d\n\nThe Jupe units will sell for between $14,500 and $78,000 for the Rest and Care units respectively, with different configurations affecting the cost, and the Plus ICU units will be available for $99,000 and above. The shelters can be delivered to one location and later sanitized for delivery somewhere else, as such the company is considering a leasing model, though during this period they will be offering units at cost, with no margins, including cost of delivery.\n\nTAGS\nCORONAVIRUSCOVID 19FLAT PACKFLAT PACK BUILDINGFLAT PACK HOUSINGHEALTH AND SAFETYHEALTHCARE DESIGNHOSPITAL DESIGNHUMANITARIAN DESIGNJUPEMEDICAL FACILITY",

        "text": "Former SpaceX, Tesla, and AirBnB Employees Introduce Sci-fi Inspired Shelter Jupe\n\nJupe has launched its first cosmos-inspired shelter units built for short-term stays. Designed for modern travelers\u2019 quest to escape dense, urban areas for the wilds of nature, Jupe provides an out-of-this-world getaway experience. Each Jupe unit is shipped as part of a chassis foundation that can be flat-packed to roam anywhere, without regard to the electrical grid, and is assembled in hours.\n\nThe Jupe structure is supported by interconnected and durable aluminum masts which make up Jupe\u2019s illuminated and distinct geometric shape. Its simple assembly and chassis foundation make it adaptable to wherever one might wander, whether that\u2019s a sprawling desert, a crowded redwood forest, the shores of an isolated lake, or a windswept coastal community.\n\nBuilt as a work of art rather than a simple dwelling, Jupe\u2019s unique shape and angular surfaces resemble a cut diamond or an interstellar shuttle more than age-old structures like RVs, cabins, tents, or yurts traditionally used in nature getaways. \n\nEach unit boasts cavernous ceiling heights of 11 feet, so users can comfortably maneuver when occupying it. Prioritizing small space with big impact, Jupe\u2019s 111-square-foot space is cloaked in a high-quality fire-resistant canvas soft-top and is grounded by finished Baltic birch wood tile-flooring.\n\nThe floors open up to individual storage cubes totaling 38.1 cubic feet of storage, enough space to store ten large suitcases. Beyond a massive interior, side windows heighten the sense of openness, providing cross-ventilation and natural light. The unit\u2019s front-facing facade can open into a single large panoramic window to take in awe-inspiring wide-angle views.\n\nSplashes of warm desert tones enliven a minimal aesthetic that merges contemporary and functional design. Upon entering a Jupe, travelers are welcomed with a queen-size bed equipped with Nectar mattresses, a designer desk, chair and ottoman.\n\nJupe\u2019s clean interior was designed in collaboration with renowned boutique hotelier Liz Lambert (formerly Bunkhouse Hotels: El Cosmico, Phoenix Hotel) and sustainable architecture expert, TED Prize Winner, and former head of social innovation at AirBnB, Cameron Sinclair.\n\nJupe units are now available for $99 pre-order at a starting price point of $17,500.",

Jupe, which was founded by entrepreneur Jeff Wilson and investment banker Cameron Blizzard to provide housing to displaced people, announced yesterday it was pivoting its efforts to address the global health crisis.\n\nThe company claims that its designs can be manufactured at a lower cost than traditional medical facilities, making them more accessible for areas with limited resources. The ICUs are designed to accommodate 12 patients and include features such as negative pressure rooms, a nurse station, and storage space for equipment and supplies.\n\nJupe has also developed pop-up care facilities in the form of shipping containers that can be used as temporary hospitals or treatment centers. These units are equipped with essential medical infrastructure and can be easily transported to areas where they are needed most.\n\nThe company is working with healthcare organizations and governments around the world to deploy these solutions quickly and effectively. Jupe believes that its designs can make a significant difference in the fight against coronavirus and other global health crises.\n\nThis article has been viewed 3 times since its publication on March 28, 2020.",

(Photo: Jeff Wilson)\nCURWOOD: Well, you certainly sound like a friendly guy, and I'm sure that you have friends, lovers, perhaps. So what kinds of guests do you have at your dumpster?\nWILSON: [LAUGHS] Well, I'll start with the latter one. I did have a girlfriend at the beginning of the experiment, and it seems that she is still around at least in the last coupleof days. And a lot of people do ask if you know this is the type of experiment that attracts the ladies, and I'll say that's a definite no. I do have frequent guests here; I don't stay in the dumpster when I have these guests\u2014and these are generally students or couch surfers. I've had people from several continents couch-surf in the dumpster; we\u2019ve got a very special guest on Thursday, I actually have the CEO of \u201ccouch-surfing\u201d itself, dumpster-surfing.\nCURWOOD: And as for your girlfriend so far she hasn't dumped you.\nWILSON: So to speak and I refrain from calling her a trashy chick.\nCURWOOD: Ooooh.\nWILSON: [LAUGHS]\nCURWOOD: So your goal for dumpster dwelling goes beyond just spending a year in a small space, it's all about educating through this project dumpster. So what do you hope to accomplish?\nWILSON: In the short-term, we've really got sort of a Zen, in the moment thing going on. We're looking to reach out to the public and reach out to our students for ideas such as ideas on this toilet. It's one of the biggest problems. I mean, the idea of a toilet, the pure ridiculousness of it\u2014that you've got to have this big piece of porcelain; you've got to have a whole sewage system. You've got to have a couple gallons of fresh water. These are some of the things that I think we're able to attack in a very small way. I mean, ultimately what this experiment is all about is not just can you be happy on a lot less, but I like to think of the dumpster as a conversation box, and as long as a conversation continues to go on, whether it be about sustainability, climate change, tiny homes or whether it be\u2014as some have suggested Obama's new housing plan\u2014as long as that conversation's going on and people are talking about it, I think we'll have accomplished our goal.\nCURWOOD: Professor Jeff Wilson teaches Environmental Studies at Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. Great talking to you from your dumpster. I hope you'll bring it to Boston and invite us for dinner, or maybe even a sleepover.\nWILSON: Hey, Boston or Austin, mi dumpster es tu casa, so just let me know next time you\u2019re around and when we're in Boston we'll drop by.\nCURWOOD: [LAUGHS] Thank you so much.",

(If any of these sponsors want to invest in things that benefit people in need of low-cost sustainable housing, we might suggest a few other worthy causes.)\n\nAlso, living in a dumpster is also actually illegal, unless you happen to own the dumpster in question. (Wilson was able to secure permission to occupy his particular dumpster from the university.)\n\nNone of that makes the fun, quirky \u201cexperiments\u201d that Wilson is performing wrong, but it does make them kind of obtuse. Wilson\u2019s experiments are fundamentally about homelessness\u2014you don\u2019t move into a dumpster unaware of the association\u2014but when he talks about \u201cWhat does home look like in a world of ten billion people\u201d by celebrating the gimmicks behind what he\u2019s doing, there\u2019s an important thing he\u2019s missing: for many people, it just looks a lot like living in a f#%$ing dumpster.\n\nWe certainly don\u2019t wish Wilson ill as he brings his bowties into 99 different people\u2019s homes, but it\u2019s hard not to see these projects as very interesting ways for the guy to get on television and in magazines, creating opportunities for corporate partners to co-brand #DumpsterLife or #CouchSurfing as a quirky way to challenge middle-class conceptions of how we live. But if the majority of the time we spend talking about people who live in dumpsters or on other people\u2019s couches involves a university professor on the hunt for a book deal, we\u2019re not creating an interesting dialogue.

Eventually, he hopes to turn his new home into a full-on \u201cspace capsule in a trash can\u201d with WiFi, air conditioning, an Xbox and other modern luxuries.\n\nThe yearlong class experiment, called The Dumpster Project, is out to prove that people can live in a lot less space but still have a rich\u2014if not richer\u2014life.\n\nWho did you consult with for the project?\n\nI recruited a world-class team that includes one of the top green designers in the world, one of the top water energy experts and people in the STEM education community. They\u2019re acting as an advisory board. But the students do the real design and thought-process work on this.\n\nWhy a dumpster and not some other small space?\n\nYou get a very shocking reaction when you tell people at a cocktail party that you\u2019re living in a dumpster. They don\u2019t say, \u201cThat\u2019s great. The weather tomorrow looks terrible.\u201d The experiment fuels a very long conversation within and between groups that don\u2019t traditionally talk about issues of living with less and sustainability.\n\nAny thoughts on how this will affect your personal life?\n\nMy mom is a Martha Stewart\u2013type and very concerned about image. If someone brings it up at her bridge club, it pokes her a little bit, but I think she secretly likes it. My girlfriend has always known [about the project]. I think once I actually move in, it will become difficult. I\u2019m on campus, so there are visitation hours.\n\nWill you be entertaining in your new place?\n\nOh yeah. We\u2019re going to have a dumpster-warming party when I move in. I want to have a couple of chairs out in the yard and a little back porch. It\u2019s one of the best views in Austin. A thousand-dollar home with a million-dollar view.",

        "text": "Meet the start-up founder who lived in a dumpster to help fix the homeownership crisis\n\nPublished Sun, Mar 12 201711:29 AM EDTUpdated Sun, Mar 12 201711:47 AM EDT\nMichelle Castillo\n\nHow living in a dumpster motivated this man to reinvent housing\nTo truly understand what\u2019s its like to live small and comfortably, Jeff Wilson gave away most of his possessions and moved into a 33-square-foot dumpster.\nNow, he thinks he has a solution to dwindling homeownership rates. His startup Kasita makes 352-square-foot smart tiny homes that are packed to the brim with technology and storage space. He\u2019s showing off a Kasita model home at the 2017 South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re solving a very old, complex problem,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cReal estate is thousands of years old. Land is where old wealthy families store all their money. So it\u2019s a very locked down system. So what we say is where are the cracks in the system?\u201d\n\nCurrent U.S. homeownership rates have dropped to a historical low, mostly because millennials aren\u2019t buying houses. Saddled by college debt and rising home prices, many can\u2019t save up to make the downpayment on market-value houses. Wages aren\u2019t increasing and cities are building new housing to meet demand, Wilson adds. At $139,000 a unit \u2014 which works out to a mortgage of about $800 a month plus land lease costs, according to Wilson \u2014 he thinks many more people can afford to call a Kasita home.\n\nWilson was previously a professor of environmental science at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. In 2014, he decided to see how much space people really needed to live comfortably. He sold most of his possessions, found a 6 foot X 5.5 foot dumpster, placed it on the university campus, and moved in with his few favorite items, including a handful of books and a few shirts.\n\n\u201cIt was absolutely insane,\u201d Wilson admitted. \u201cI just wanted to try it for an experiment, what happens when you push the absolute limits of small and base level.\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d lived in his repurposed home for about one year, save a few nights when he was traveling or staying with friends. But even though he learned ways to make the space seem larger like painting the walls white and creative storage hacks, there were still some things he couldn\u2019t fix. Architects and engineers couldn\u2019t figure out how to fit a kitchen and bathroom inside the dumpster. He resorted to using the dorm and school gym bathrooms.\n\nJeff Wilson lived in a dumpster for about one year to see if he could downsize into a tiny space.Courtesy of Molly Mandell\n\nWhat Wilson learned was while 33 square feet might be too small, people could definitely downsize their living space in order to have more disposable income for traveling and other experiences. However, a house had to feel like a home and not make the person give up any conveniences.\n\nSure, Kasita\u2019s are tiny at first glance. But, they come with ultra-modern amenities like Amazon Alexa-powered lighting modes and dynamic windows that have programmable tint modes, as well as a clever design that maximizes its space while giving you tons of storage options. For example, a small staircase can be pulled out like a dresser, while the queen-sized bed completely tucks under the kitchen floor when not in use.\n\n\u201cThis is a 12,000-pound piece of hardware filled with software,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Internet of Things are really useful until it becomes the Internet of experience.\u201d\n\nThe pods are portable with a crane, and can be placed anywhere. Wilson sees a future where people can rent spaces on parking structures or stack Kasita\u2019s in premium spaces to take advantage of great location.\n\nAnd, Wilson is embracing the small lifestyle permanently. After SXSW, he plans to move into into the model Kasita with his partner. He\u2019s downsized his possessions even more. He\u2019s down to one shirt.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you caught me on the day after I dry cleaned it,\u201d he joked.",

Wilson, college dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is highlighted for his daring challenge to live inside of a 33-square-foot trash container. It\u2019s all part of the Dumpster Project, an experiment he\u2019s developing with students to build a \u201clow-impact, zero-net-waste\u201d dwelling out of the trash container.\n\nIt was interesting to learn about how many items of convenience Wilson has stripped from his life to place himself basically in solitary confinement: He\u2019s got no toilet or shower (he uses the university\u2019s), no washer and dryer for his clothes (he uses the laundromat), and his wardrobe is reduced to a few pairs of pants and shirts, three hats, and \u201ceight or nine\u201d bowties.\n\nIt\u2019s basically a crib \u2014 though when finally complete, it will be something that could possibly revive MTV Cribs. Here\u2019s what it will look like:\n\nThis was not mentioned in the story, but his school, Huston-Tillotson, is a historically black university. The student group Hamblin does mention, Green is the New Black, is the Huston-Tillotson student organization that is driving the Dumpster Project, and it is holding its inaugural Building Green Justice Forum on campus on Sept. 25.\n\nHuston-Tillotson is spotlighted in the report I just wrote about that highlights environmental work and progress at historically black schools. In particular Huston-Tillotson gets props for its Dumpster 101 curriculum, based on this project, and also its off-campus activity, like the STEM program it\u2019s created for K-12 classes. It\u2019s kinda criminal that Huston-Tillotson isn\u2019t getting more attention.\n\nThe article continues with:\n\nA message from   \nAll donations matched for a limited time!\nGrist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Professor Dumpster, in his bid to become part of the 'new 1%' will strive to use 1% the water, 1% the energy, and create 1% the waste of the average American home,\" reads The Dumpster Project website.\n\nWe first came across Wilson over at The Atlantic, where they describe his downsizing from a 2,500-square-foot house to a 500-square-foot apartment and finally to the 36-square-foot dumpster. For reference, that's 152 square feet less than the self-proclaimed \"world's smallest house\" in London, 204 square feet less than a typical $30,000 tiny house, and 92 square feet smaller than the tiny house in which a Business Insider reporter spent the weekend with her mom.\n\nThe Dumpster Project will be completed in three phases, starting when Wilson took occupancy in February 2014: camping in a bare-bones dumpster; living in a dumpster \"home,\" with additions such as storage and a bed; and then fine-tuning the dumpster into the ultimate sustainable home.\n\nEarlier in stage two, the project's current stage, a fake floor was installed to store Wilson's belongings and limited wardrobe.\n\nLater in this stage, the dumpster will be hooked up to electricity and water. Measurements will be taken of how much of these resources Wilson requires to be comfortable.\n\nNow, the dumpster is starting to look a little more like home. Here, you can see its garden beds, mailbox, and sole window.\n\nWilson told The Atlantic that in the summer, his Texan dumpster can easily top 100 degrees, making it unbearable during the day. Luckily, he can take refuge in his office. Until an exterior composting toilet and shower are installed, he will continue relying on the university's facilities.\n\nThis photo was taken from the dumpster's sole window, which also functions as the door.\n\nThis shot from the \"skylight,\" \"retractable roof,\" or \"lid,\" depending on what you want to call it, gives a pretty good idea of the dumpster's dimensions.\n\nIn the third and final stage, which hasn't yet begun, the team will continue adding to the home with a focus on making sure it uses 1% of the energy and water used in of the average American home.",

        "text": "Professor Dumpster Moves Out of the Dumpster, Begins Couchsurfing\n\nNicole Dieker\nPublished in The Billfold\nMar 6, 2015\n\nA quick recap of the intrepid adventures of Jeff Wilson, the man who calls himself Professor Dumpster:\n\nIn 2013, Wilson met Clara Bensen on OKCupid and invited her on a 21-day international trip where they had no itinerary, no plans, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 could only travel with the clothes on their back. This is relevant to the story only because New Line Cinema bought the rights to turn that story into a rom-com.\n\nIn 2014, Wilson moved into a dumpster behind the women's dormitory at Huston-Tillotson University in East Austin. Over the past year, Wilson converted the dumpster into a tiny home, complete with air conditioning \u2014 it is Austin, after all \u2014 as well as the full support of the university where he is both professor and dean of the University College. A student group, Green Is the New Black, helped him with his project and slept in the dumpster on nights when Wilson elected to sleep elsewhere.\n\nThis is where people begin to project their own emotions onto the story: why did he pick the dumpster behind the women's dorm? Why do I feel weird about students sleeping over in their professor's living space, even if he isn't there? How does Wilson balance dumpster life with parenting his elementary-school-aged daughter?\n\nAnd here\u2019s one new emotion that I just picked up this morning: why did none of the Professor Dumpster articles that I read over the past year mention that Huston-Tillotson University is an Historically Black College? If there are students of color who helped Professor Dumpster build his dumpster house, their faces should have been photographed next to his.\n\nBut we don\u2019t have to worry about any of that anymore, because Professor Dumpster is moving out of the dumpster \u2014 and if you live in Austin, he might be coming to a couch near you.\n\nThe new social experiment or whatever that Wilson will be undertaking is called \u201c99 Nights ATX,\u201d and it involves sleeping on 99 different couches, over 99 days, in Austin. According to the project's website, it was a response to the idea \u201cthat dissecting and debating the inexorable winds of change is practically the city\u2019s unofficial pastime \u2014 right behind music festivals and craft beer tastings.\u201d\n\nYes, Professor Dumpster is going couchsurfing. The Texas Monthly notes that he\u2019s also looking for project funding \u2014 but when I follow the link to his 99 Nights ATX sponsor page it looks like he\u2019s actually looking for corporate sponsors.\n\nJeff will spend 99 nights in 99 different homes gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their inner spaces. Sarah Natsumi Moore, an established Austin photographer, will document the journey with her camera and Clara Bensen, a local writer, will compile short stories to accompany each home.\n\nWe will learn a lot about the former Professor Dumpster and his team by the people he chooses to stay with and the stories his team chooses to tell about them.",

        "text": "Letting go and Letting IN the World with Professor Dumpster\n\nApril 23, 2015/1 Comment/in News 'n Views/by Brenda Avadian STUFFologist\n\nJeff Wilson piqued my interest when I came upon an article in The Atlantic, last year.\n\nWho moves from a 3,000-square foot home to a 500-square foot apartment, and then down to a 36-square foot dumpster?\n\nWhat\u2019s surprising? He\u2019s an environmental science professor at Huston-Tillotson University (HTU) AND a dean!\n\nI had to meet him when I flew into Austin for a board meeting earlier this month.\n\nWhat\u2019s his story?\n\nHe\u2019s the test variable in his own research, exploring the boundaries of conventional living options.\n\nCan one live in a space of 36-square feet?\n\nThe first half of the year, he endured sparse amenities, sponge baths at a sink in one of the university\u2019s bathrooms, and sub-freezing nights. The second half of the year, he added some creature comforts with air conditioning and a futon bed.\n\nAs a professor, he inspires by example. His students remain curious about sustainability in their own lives. He welcomes teachers to spend a night through his Dumpster Project \u201cHome\u201d School residency program. (Scroll to \u201cEducation Programs\u201d in the PDF that opens.) His DumpterProject.org even offers educational opportunities for 5th and 7th grade science\u2014helping young people understand sustainability of water, food, and energy.\n\nWhat unfolded was quite unexpected.\n\nWe met for breakfast on a rainy morning at a small neighborhood restaurant two miles east of the Capitol.\n\nDonning a professorial corduroy jacket with elbow patches and a tie that had seen better days, he exuded an air of humility and warmth.\n\nHe told me about his research project, The Dumpster Project. He had moved into a 36-square foot space in downtown Austin to explore how little living can be done while still having quality of life.\n\nHe shared stories about the people he met along the way\u2014people who were struggling with poverty, addiction, or homelessness\u2014and how they had managed to live on the margins, often without access to basic necessities like clean water and sanitation.\n\nHe spoke about his own struggles in adapting to this new lifestyle. He had given up many of his possessions, including his television, computer, and even his books. He was learning to appreciate the simple things in life, like a warm shower or a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\nAs we talked, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of awe at his commitment to his research project. It wasn\u2019t just about living in a small space; it was about challenging himself and others to rethink their relationship with stuff.\n\nHe showed me the video he had made about The Dumpster Project, which I found fascinating. He explained that he wanted to make people think differently about consumption and waste.\n\nHe spoke about the impact of his research on his students and colleagues. Many were inspired by his example and began to re-evaluate their own priorities and values.\n\nAs we finished our breakfast, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of gratitude for having met Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster. His story was a powerful reminder that living simply doesn\u2019t have to mean sacrificing quality of life. In fact, it can be quite the opposite.\n\nBy letting go of things we often think are necessary, he has created a life of freedom, flexibility, and fun. For example, he and his girlfriend/writer, Clara Bensen, completed several trips to different countries around the world without any baggage.",

        "text": "Is it possible to live both sustainably and affordably? One University professor thinks so. Jeff Wilson, a professor at Huston-Tillotson University, has embarked on an ambitious project - The Dumpster Project. Wilson is attempting to build a sustainable home using reclaimed materials from dumpsters.\n\nThe project aims to prove that living environmentally friendly does not have to be expensive. Wilson and his team are designing the house using recycled materials, solar power, and other innovative technologies. They hope to create a model for affordable and sustainable housing that can be replicated in low-income communities.\n\nWilson's approach is twofold. He wants to show that being environmentally conscious doesn't have to break the bank, but also that affordability is essential when it comes to sustainability. \"This may be a $100,000 Dumpster home,\" he says, \"but the next project might be the tiniest house built to code, and the next could be a tiny home for under $20,000.\"\n\nThe Dumpster Project has already gained attention from local students and community leaders. The Blackshear Elementary School is involved in the project, and its principal, Betty Jenkins, has expressed enthusiasm about the initiative. Amanda Masino, another teacher at the school, sees the potential of the project to engage minority communities in environmental discussions.\n\nAngelica Erazo, a student who recently won a $1,000 award from Home Depot for her ideas on sustainability, believes that The Dumpster Project can help people understand that being environmentally friendly doesn't have to be expensive. \"You can save money being green,\" she says, pointing out simple behaviors like turning off lights.\n\nThe project has received funding from various sources, including a $100,000 grant from an unnamed donor. However, Wilson emphasizes that the ultimate goal is not just about building a sustainable home but also about developing a model for affordable living.\n\nThe Dumpster Project aims to address pressing issues such as climate change, affordability, and social justice. By exploring innovative solutions like using recycled materials, solar power, and tiny homes, the project hopes to make sustainability accessible to everyone, regardless of income or background.",

Wilson will also give a \"tour\" of his dumpster/home.\n\nNot long ago, Wilson was nesting in a 2,500 square foot house. After going through a divorce (\"nothing related to the dumpster,\" he told me, unsolicited), he spun into the archetypal downsizing of a newly minted bachelor. He moved into a 500-square-foot apartment. Then he began selling clothes and furniture on Facebook for almost nothing. Now he says almost everything he owns is in his 36-square-foot dumpster, which is sanctioned and supported by the university as part of an ongoing sustainability-focused experiment called The Dumpster Project.\n\nFor Professor Dumpster, the undertaking is at once grand and diminutive, selfless and introspective, silly and gravely important, even dark. \"We bring everything into the home these days,\" Wilson said. \"You don't really need to leave the home for anything, even grocery shopping, anymore. What's interesting about this is it's really testing the limits of what you need in a home.\"\n\n\"The big hypothesis we're trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\" He paused. \"This is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I'd say. A better life than I had before.\"\n\nThe talk will take place Friday, September 26 at 4:30 in Huston-Tillotson University's AL Auditorium at 900 Chicon Street.\n\nThis event is co-sponsored by the Department of American Studies, the Graduate Program in Community and Regional Planning, and Plan II Honors. We hope to see you there.",

        "text": "Professor Goes Green: He'll Live in Dumpster for a Year\nBy Kayle Fields February 5, 2014\n\nIt's the ultimate in going green. An environmental science professor is making a 33-square-foot dumpster his new home for the next year.\n\nHis name is Dr. Jeff Wilson, but since embarking on this journey, he's now going by Professor Dumpster. He teaches at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, and received his Ph.D. from Harvard.\n\nThe goal is to embrace energy efficiency, and to prove that it is possible to live on a smaller scale - a much smaller scale. This whole project revolves around using one percent of what an average American uses: one percent of the water, energy and waste.\n\n\"We really needed some sort of excitement around science, sustainability and technology,\" says Wilson.\n\nHe says the idea came to him over two years ago. Since then he's been recruiting a world-class team of professors, scientists and environmentalists to make his idea a reality.\n\n\"My hypothesis is that my life will be better,\" Wilson says. \"I'll be fulfilling a richer life by living a smaller life.\"\n\nLast night was the first night in his new home. Wilson says that in this phase of the project, the only thing he has to keep him warm during the cold Texas nights is his sleeping bag.\n\nHe's embracing the simplicity, and welcoming the changes that will come in the next year of the project. Instead of being strapped down to expensive monthly rent, he'll be a homeowner with his mortgage paid off.\n\nBut dumpster living comes with challenges, like walking a mile down the hill to the town lake for water.\n\nThe outlook is positive, though. Wilson says in six months he hopes to have things like an air conditioner and an X-box. A shower, a toilet and even WiFi is in the works, too.\n\nDr. Wilson has a whole team behind him, including a student organization called Green is the New Black. He says team members can even volunteer to spend the night in the dumpster and give him the night off. As the project progresses, the team will be fundraising for low-energy appliances and electronics, and will monitor the energy used on the team's blog.\n\nHe'll be taking his dumpster home to local elementary schools and sharing his project with the students. It gives the students the opportunity to give him design ideas and ask questions. One of the most pressing so far: \"How is Santa going to get in?\"\n\nTo follow Dr. Wilson and his team's journey through dumpster living, check out the blog at dumpsterproject.org.",

        "text": "John Kelso\nOne of the ancillary experiments Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, might conduct when he lives in a garbage dumpster for a year?\nWilson, a dean at Huston-Tillotson University who teaches environmental sciences, might move the dumpster to various Austin neighborhoods to see how the neighbors react.\n\u201cI mean, what\u2019s going to happen in the morning when I crawl out of a dumpster?\u201d Wilson asked.\n\nIf he sets up the dumpster in Tarrytown or West Lake Hills, one of the neighbors might lob an empty Dom Pe\u0301rignon bottle in on top of him. Don\u2019t they know that goes in the recycling?\n\nWilson is one of those energetic college professors who students will remember for the rest of their lives, thanks to his imagination and creativity. Along with thinking outside the box, he\u2019ll be living in it. Truth is, students retain what their entertaining teachers tell them.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to hear another lecture about how the world is going to be destroyed if everybody doesn\u2019t drive a Prius,\u201d said Wilson, a seventh-generation Texan who grew up on a farm. \u201cThey want to see some action.\u201d\n\nWilson will indeed be taking action \u2013 and living in a dumpster \u2013 as part of an effort to raise awareness about homelessness and poverty.\n\nHe will also have to deal with the logistics of living in a small space with limited amenities. He has already begun planning his meals, which will include dried goods like beans and rice, and has lined up help from friends and colleagues to keep his social calendar filled.\n\nWilson is not the first person to live in a dumpster \u2013 or at least, not the first person who has attempted it. Several years ago, a man named Mark McMillan lived in a dumpster outside the state capitol building in Austin for 24 hours as part of a publicity stunt.\n\nBut Wilson's effort will be different, he says, because it will be longer-lasting and more focused on education. He plans to keep a journal and write about his experiences, which will then be used to help educate others about homelessness and poverty.\n\nThe idea for the project came to him after he attended a conference at Huston-Tillotson University last year. The conference was about social justice and human rights, and Wilson says it made him realize how much work there is yet to be done in these areas.\n\nHe has already begun preparing his home \u2013 a 10x8 foot dumpster behind the university's president's house \u2013 for his stay. He has installed windows, a bed, and other amenities that will make living in the small space more bearable.\n\nThe dumpster itself is not particularly clean or spacious, but Wilson says he's prepared to live with it. \u201cIt's going to be cramped,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it might get dirty. But I'm used to that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nWilson has also set up a blog where people can follow his progress and offer suggestions for meals and other things he'll need during his stay. He plans to update the blog regularly, which will help him keep track of his experiences and make sure he's making progress on his goals.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Wilson is optimistic about his project. \u201cI think it could be really powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I'm excited to see how it all turns out.\u201d\n\nThe dumpster experiment is not without its critics, however. Some have raised concerns about health and safety issues related to living in a small space with limited access to clean water, food, and sanitation.\n\nBut Wilson says he's taken steps to address these concerns. He has consulted with experts on public health and sanitation, and has made arrangements for regular check-ins from medical professionals to ensure his health is not at risk.\n\nHe also plans to keep a record of any problems or issues that arise during his stay, which will be used to help educate others about the challenges faced by people living in poverty.\n\nIn addition to raising awareness about homelessness and poverty, Wilson hopes to inspire people to take action. \u201cI think it could be really motivating,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I'm excited to see how it all turns out.\u201d\n\nThe dumpster experiment is expected to last for 30 days, during which time Wilson will live in the small space with limited access to clean water, food, and sanitation.\n\nHe has set up a schedule for his stay, which includes regular check-ins from medical professionals and visits from friends and colleagues to keep him company.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, Wilson remains optimistic about his project. \u201cI think it could be really powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I'm excited to see how it all turns out.\u201d",

        "text": "Professor Dumpster Moves Out ... And On\nHe's leaving the Dumpster to a new, rotating cast of residents\nBY NORA ANKRUM, FRI., FEB. 6, 2015\n\nHas it really been a year already? Apparently so, says Huston-Tillotson University College Dean Jeff Wilson, who on Tuesday night concluded his year-in-residence in Austin's most esteemed trash can. During the depths of last winter's cold spell, the biology professor moved into a Dumpster on the west side of HT's campus with little more than a sleeping bag and an iPhone for comfort. As an experiment in \"less is more\" living, the Dumpster Project was intended to test the limits of both sustainable design and sanity.\n\nIn regard to the latter, says Wilson, \"I'm way happier than before I moved into the Dumpster.\" It turns out that a 6-by-6-foot metal box makes an adequate cave for reading, napping, or getting away from it all. At the same time, says Wilson, \"you're just kind of forced to engage more, and I think that's a big part of why I'm happier.\"\n\nHe notes that the low rent and \"minute-and-a-half\" commute to the office don't hurt either. \"We didn't make it to that sort of uber-Dumpster that we wanted,\" says Wilson. \"One of the lessons learned is that it's pretty damn hard to renovate your house when you're living in it.\" A composting toilet, pop-up balcony, and other experimental design elements went unrealized.\n\nStill, the project team planted gardens, installed data monitoring equipment, and got an air-conditioning unit (more important than a bathroom, discovered Wilson). Other additions are forthcoming as part of student-driven Brainstorm for the Box design challenges. Wilson gave the Dumpster a fresh coat of paint last week in anticipation of its next guest, Blackshear Elementary School Principal Betty Jenkins, who planned to stay overnight Wednesday to kick off the Dump\u00adster Project \"Home\" School residency program.\n\nOther resident teachers will follow (students can nominate a teacher at www.dumpsterproject.org/homeschool). All will return to the classroom with a Dumpster 101 curriculum developed in partnership with EcoRise and Blackshear, and piloted by the roughly 1,000 K-12 students who visited the Dumpster over the last year. Wilson, meanwhile, is postponing a return to normalcy.\n\nInstead, he'll be spending 99 nights in different homes around town (e.g., mansion, high-rise condo, nursing home, under a bridge), all documented and photographed by his partner, writer Clara Benson, and photographer Sarah Natsumi Moore. \"There's such a real housing crisis in Austin,\" says Wilson. \"This doesn't go directly to the heart of that, but it sort of dances around it.\"\n\nVisit www.dumpsterproject.org for more information on the Dumpster Project and its future plans.",

        "text": "Professor to Live \u2018Green\u2019 in Dumpster\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 5, 2014\n\nIf you think your house is a dump, try moving into an actual Dumpster.\nA biology professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, TX, is doing just that\u2014in an attempt to educate his students about sustainable living.\n\nDr. Jeff Wilson, Associate Professor of Biological Sciences at Huston-Tillotson University, will spend one year living in a Dumpster.\nDr. Jeff Wilson recently sold his possessions to move into the sanitized 33-square-foot Dumpster for a year, according to local news reports and the project website.\n\nDumpster Digs\nThe idea for the project came to Wilson when he was in a Starbucks coffee shop thinking of ways to make his research more interactive and looked outside to see a Dumpster, he told KXAN Austin News.\n\u201cA Dumpster is the perfect symbol to present themes on waste and consumption in an engaging way,\u201d according to project details.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird. It\u2019s fun. It gets the wheels of imagination turning.\u201d\n\n3 Phases\nThe project will involve three phases of Dumpster living: a camping site; an average American (Dumpster) home; and a space-capsule design or \u00fcber Dumpster. At each stage, students from elementary school to college will pitch in to plan and test solutions for the abode. Experts will also offer advice.\n\nIn the first phase, \"Professor Dumpster\" (Wilson\u2019s nickname) will have a 15-degree-rated sleeping bag for camping in the trash can tent. (Temperatures in Austin have been in the 40s this week.) He will filter water for drinking from a nearby lake and use campus facilities for bathing.\n\nDuring the second phase, the Dumpster will be flashier, \u201cplugged into the electrical and water grid\u201d and feature appliances, such as a washing machine and dryer, according to project details.\n\nUltimately, Wilson wants to answer this question: \u201cCan you have a pretty good life living in 1 percent of the average new American home with 1 percent the energy, 1 percent the water, and 1 percent the waste?\u201d\n\nIn the third phase, the student team will attempt to get one percent of the energy and water use of an average American home, all contained in the tiny container.\n\nAt the end of the project, Wilson hopes to answer this question: \u201cCan you have a pretty good life living in 1 percent of the average new American home with 1 percent the energy, 1 percent the water, and 1 percent the waste?\u201d\n\nThe Ford Foundation is donating $75,000 to the effort.\n\nExpert Advisor\nOthers have also tossed around the idea of Dumpster living.\nIn 2011, California artist Gregory Kloehn transformed a trash container into a fully functional home, equipped with a working kitchen, toilet, storage and sleeping area.\n\nKloehn is listed as a \u201cDumpster Yoda\u201d who will provide expert advice to the Dumpster Project team.",

On Tuesday, Feb. 4 at 1 p.m., (CST) movers will deliver Wilson\u2019s new abode to the HT campus at 900 Chicon Street, completely furnished with zilch.\n\nWilson, a recognized expert in the fields of Environmental Science and Environmental Health, is also Executive Director of The Dumpster Project, a registered Texas nonprofit focused on transforming sustainability education. He leads the project with a multi-disciplinary team of designers, academics, and students.  In his role as \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d at HT, he promotes Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) education focused on reducing carbon footprints in an engaging, entertaining format. He has intrigued students with his methods in his popular Freshman Seminar class.\n\nThe students compiled a presentation around the theme titled, \u201cBuilding Sustainable Communities\u201d that captured an educational program to address issues of sustainability in Black and Hispanic communities.  The group introduced the challenge of transforming a 33-square foot dumpster into a fully functioning home complete with running water, toilet, shower, bed, and solar-generated electricity. Some students also plan to live in the dumpster.\n\n\u201cThe overarching goal of The Dumpster Project is to test whether one can have a pretty good life while treading lightly on the planet\u2014all from a dumpster that is one percent the size of an average home,\u201d said Dr. Wilson.\n\nDuring the past five years, HT has enhanced its STEM offerings by developing new Environmental Studies courses, renovating the Dickey-Lawless Science Building, retrofitting and upgrading the laboratories, incorporating energy efficient lighting with sensors, and installing new heating and air conditioning units throughout the campus to support carbon footprint reduction and sustainability efforts.\n\nRecently, HT was named a finalist in the 2014 Second Nature Climate Leadership Awards (CLA).  The annual competition is held among United States colleges and universities that are signatories of the American College & University Presidents\u2019 Climate Commitment (ACUPCC). The awards program is sponsored by Second Nature, a national nonprofit that seeks to create a sustainable society by transforming higher education, and Planet Forward, an organization that engages innovators and publishes compelling ideas for some of society\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\nFollow the coverage:\n\n* KVUE (ABC)\n* KXAN (NBC)\n* FOX\n* Austin American-Statesman\n* Yahoo News\n* Culture Map\n* HBCUConnect",

        "text": "Meet the College Dean Who Lives in a Dumpster\nSeptember 22, 2014\n\nPlenty of people live in cramped quarters. A third of rural Indians live in homes where each person gets just 65 square feet or less of living space.\nBut at 33 square feet, Austin University College Dean Jeff Wilson, a.k.a Professor Dumpster, has got them beat with his Dumpster Project.\n\nWilson took post-divorce downsizing to a whole new level by moving into a dumpster on the campus of the university where he teaches, paring down his possessions to some bedding, a couple shirts, and a few pairs of shoes and pants. The only thing Wilson did not skimp on was bowties (he has eight or nine), which arguably are necessary to add some flair to his otherwise limited wardrobe.\n\nWilson moved from a just-under-the-national-average 2,500-square foot home to the dumpster, which he is utilizing as an experiment to illustrate issues of sustainability and human needs to his students. According to him, he has become more connected to his community since living in the dumpster.\n\n\"I have met a much wider circle of people just from going to laundromats and wandering around outside of the dumpster when I would\u2019ve been in there if I had a large flat screen and a La-Z Boy,\u201d he says.\n\nHis zero-waste, zero-energy home lacks certain amenities most Americans would consider basic, such as a toilet. But Wilson, who admits his project is \"an outlier experiment,\"  is not alone there; even in the wealthiest country on earth, 1.6 million Americans lack indoor plumbing.\n\nWilson does have plans for a toilet, as well as a shower and a washer/dryer (so long, laundromat), all fueled by city water, a connection to the electrical grid, and a shade structure to protect the dumpster from the scorching Texas sun. Longer term plans include a pop-up bedroom structure, folding balcony, and raised bed garden.\n\nWilson's goal is to demonstrate what is possible with ingenuity and a willingness to rethink how much stuff a person needs to own and store in a house for a happy life.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home,\u201d he tells.",

He apparently had a lot of time to think in his dingy dumpster digs, and has since designed a line of tiny but technologically power-packed homes being manufactured in Austin.\n\nWilson calls the design Kasita - inspired by \"casita\", which is Spanish for \"small house\". He told KVUE-TV that his iPhone, which I'm sure was his only company in that dumpster, inspired him to create a home that would utilize every inch of space and pack features into a compact and sleek design.\n\nTech features include windows that dim or clear on command, a TV that slides in and out of view depending on when its needed, and customized ambient settings, all controlled by an app. They'll be on display at this year's South by Southwest festival in Austin, so look for them if you have a chance to head down there.\n\nEach 352 square foot house costs about $139,000, and there are plans in the works to build racks upon which to stack the homes like portable apartments.",

        "text": "They call him Professor Dumpster, and no, this is not a put down. Dr. Jeff Wilson of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas literally (or litter-ally as he likes to spell it) lives in a dumpster.\n\nIt's all part of The Dumpster Project, an experiment in sustainability that sees Professor Dumpster and students at Huston-Tillotson retrofitting a dumpster to meet sustainable and livable standards. \"Science needs to be juiced up a bit,\" said Wilson. \"I have been an environmental science teacher for the past six years, and I'm tired of kids falling asleep in class.\"\n\nThe Dumpster Project has certainly gotten people's attention. Dr. Wilson and his students recently hosted a \"dumpster warming\" party to mark the start of what will hopefully be a long a fruitful endeavor for all involved. Around 250 people came to the event, which was accompanied by student presentations related to the project.\n\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of the Dumpster Project is its symbolic nature, as Wilson will be conserving resources where they are normally discarded. Nevertheless, Wilson believes that facilitating dialogue is more important than metaphorical meaning. \"The end game is that the dumpster becomes a conversation,\" said Wilson. \"For some people it'll be about sustainability, for some people it will be about less is more, for some people it will be a business proposition. We just want a conversation.\"\n\nAs of now, the dumpster is still in what Wilson describes as the \"primitive camping\" phase. This means that Wilson is essentially camping, except that his tent is a dumpster. But Wilson plans on transforming his humble abode into an \"\u00fcber dumpster\" equipped with solar powered electricity while at the same time using only 1% of the energy and water used in a normal American home.\n\n\"This is an experiment to show that one can have a pretty good life using limited resources.\" While initially trepidatious, the administration at Huston-Tillotson is now fully supportive of the project. But not everyone is as enthusiastic, as some bizarre and misdirected criticism has come his way. \"I've been accused of telling people that under Obama we have to live in dumpsters,\" said Wilson.\n\nThough the project has undeniably provoked discussion, the educational opportunities that it provides is perhaps its most tangible effect. For the students at Huston-Tillotson, an historically black college, this aspect of the Dumpster Project is invaluable.\n\n\"What's so cool (about the project) is the students,\" said Wilson \"Over 90% are first generation university students, and for them to have exposure to global experts is an amazing opportunity.\"\n\nWilson particularly highlights the contributions of Green is the New Black, a student group at Huston-Tillotson that is committed to transforming the environmental conversation within African-American and Latino communities.\n\nYou can follow the Dumpster Project's progress on Professor Dumpster's Twitter and Instagram pages.",

(removed)\n\nAUSTIN SOUTHWEST AUSTIN DEVELOPMENT\nAustin's 'Professor Dumpster' debuts new microhouse during SXSW\n\nBy Marie Albiges | 12:19 AM Mar 12, 2017 CST\n\nKasita CEO Jeff Wilson debuted the new microhouse at SXSW 2017.\n\nComing in at a snug 352 square feet, the Kasita house can be yours for $139,000. The first house will be delivered at the end of June, but prospective buyers can tour the model home at 1304 E. Fourth St.\n\nThe application for orders opened Friday, and while the company will not reveal how many orders it has received since Friday, Kasita Director of Communications Courtney Lowell said they are \"overwhelmingly pleased\" with the demand.\n\n\"Everything is designed with the idea of user experience,\" Lowell said of the microhouse. That means smart home technology, greater use of storage space and easy delivery\u2014Kasitas are manufactured in a factory in a few weeks and delivered in one piece via flatbed truck.\n\nBy December, Kasita hopes to start selling stackable houses. Imagine nine tiny homes, one on top of the other, accessible by an exterior, covered elevator, on a lot that would otherwise be unusable, Lowell said.\n\nThe houses on sale now even come with a discount\u2014buy three or more, and the price drops to $119,000 each.\n\nLowell said, eventually, the company hopes to see the units sold for an even more affordable price.\n\nShe said Austin was the perfect place to create and debut the Kasita, outside of technology-heavy areas ,such as Silicon Valley and New York City. Austin, she argues, is the \"quintessential\" place to launch Kasitas because of its current housing situation.\n\nCommunity leaders have said the key to making Austin affordable is to make affordable housing available. According to data from the Austin Board of Realtors, the median single-family home price in Austin rose 10.6 percent to $345,000 since September 2015. The National Association of Homebuilders reports for every $1,000 increase in the median home value, 1,285 Austin families can no longer afford the market.\n\nLowell said the idea is to place Kasitas in underutilized spaces\u2014rooftops, parking lots, areas that are too small to build conventional houses or apartments. And similar to an iPhone, Kasitas are able to be mass-produced because there is not much customization, so it is less expensive to manufacture.\n\nWilson\u2014who started out in a 33-square-foot-dumpster on Austin's Huston-Tillotson University campus three years ago\u2014said he hopes his product eventually goes global.",

        "text": "Meet Professor Dumpster, the American College Professor Who Lives in a Dumpster\n\nDr. Jeff Wilson, a professor of environmental science at a university in Austin, Texas, is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year. He kickstarted the unique project in February, and his efforts have earned him the nickname \u2018Professor Dumpster\u2019 among his students.\n\nHarvard-educated Wilson says that his goal is to show people that it is possible to have a pretty good life even in austere conditions. The dark green dumpster is currently parked behind the women\u2019s residence halls in a corner of Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s campus. Wilson describes it as \u2018the most thoughtfully designed, tiniest home ever constructed\u2019.\n\nBefore he moved in, Wilson's students cleaned and fixed the dumpster for him, making it habitable. They added a bed, a desk, and other essentials to make living in the small space possible.\n\nThe idea behind Professor Dumpster is to test whether people can live comfortably with minimal resources. The project aims to show that even without modern conveniences like air conditioning or a refrigerator, one can still have a good life.\n\nWilson has been living in the dumpster for several months now and says it's been a surprisingly pleasant experience. He spends most of his time studying, teaching, and working on projects related to environmental science.\n\nDespite the challenges, Wilson claims he is healthier and happier than he was before moving into the dumpster. His blood pressure has decreased, and he feels more energized.\n\nOne of the biggest surprises for Wilson has been how much money he's saved by living in the dumpster. He estimates that he's saving around $1,000 per month on rent alone.\n\nWhen his year is up, Wilson plans to take his bin across the United States, to educate students about the concept of \u2018less is more\u2019.",

The average home is more than 2,400 square feet.\n\nWilson added solar panels, electrical hook-ups and air conditioning to the space.\n\nEven though he is moving out, Wilson said the dumpster will remain on campus.\n\n\"We are launching what we call a dumpster home school. So under that effort teachers and educators can spend a night in here. Walk home, back to the classroom with curriculum on sustainability about living on less,\" he said.\n\nWilson said he hopes more affordable housing options that also conserve energy can be made available worldwide, and his next plan is to work on adding a second story on the dumpster.",

        "text": "College professor teaches a lesson in sustainability by living in a dumpster\nAs \"Professor Dumpster,\" Jeff Wilson is learning -- and teaching his college students -- how to live efficiently in a former trash receptacle.\nJess Zimmerman\nPublished\nOct 08, 2013\nTopic\nClimate + Culture\nJeff \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d Wilson isn\u2019t the first dumpster-dweller we\u2019ve encountered \u2014 there\u2019s this guy in New York, and these tiny dwellings in Germany, and Oscar the Grouch.  Clearly there\u2019s a certain type of mind that looks at a giant trash bin and thinks \u201chome sweet home.\u201d But Wilson, an honest-to-god environmental science professor at Huston Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is the first one we know of to make college students part of his dumpster-based life.\nHe started his dumpsterventure by selling off everything he owned, \u201cexcept for a suitcase filled with dumpster-ready essentials, a Sun God totem from Kazakhstan, and a pair of lederhosen.\u201d Then he moved on into the former trash receptacle, where he\u2019ll spend a year tracking his waste, water, and energy usage.\nHe\u2019ll start by sleeping on the floor in the bare-bones cleaned-out bin, but by the end of the project, Wilson and his students will have kitted out the dumpster to be the ultimate efficient living space:\nNext, Wilson and his students will make it comfortable, but wasteful, installing modern conveniences like air conditioning, lights and a toilet. Its inefficiency will be carefully tracked in order to develop a baseline. \u201cI\u2019m actually going to, for a few days, carry all my water in five gallon buckets up from town lake, filter it, and use it in the dumpster,\u201d says Wilson.\nOnce it\u2019s fully operational, they\u2019ll take this deluxe dumpster and give it the full no-impact-man treatment. \u201cI might say, \u2018Looks like that drier is really hogging a lot of energy; What would happen if I just sold that on Craigslist and made myself a clothesline?\u2019\u201d Wilson says. He imagines proceeding from low-hanging fruit like energy-efficient bulbs to nano-insulation and energy-producing toilets, \u201cuntil eventually, we get a completely pimped out dumpster.\u201d\nThe plan is for Wilson\u2019s students to enact similar efficiency improvements in their dorms \u2014 and his \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d character will even spread the message to younger kids. But perhaps not Wilson\u2019s own 6-year-old: \u201c\u201cMy ex-wife did not express a lot of encouragement in our daughter sleeping with daddy in a dumpster.\u201d",

He has now left his 2x2m living quarters \u2014 and says it wasn\u2019t rubbish at all.\n\nThe professor\u2019s dumpster home was just 2x2m. Picture: Molly Mandell\n\nJeff Wilson became known as Professor Dumpster after he moved into a bin for a year.\nThe environmental science lecturer has now left his unusual, 2x2m living quarters \u2014 but he says it wasn\u2019t rubbish at all.\n\nProf Wilson, from Austin, Texas, claims he was liberated by living in the cramped dumpster on campus at Huston-Tillotson University.\n\nHe and his students made it as comfortable and sustainable as possible. Picture: Sarah Natsumi\n\nThe 6ft 1in professor spent a year living on campus in the cramped space. Picture: Sarah Natsumi\n\nHe had no water or electricity, so he went back to basics. Picture: Molly Mandell\nThanks goodness for smartphones. Picture: Molly Mandell\n\n\u201cI wanted to test the absolute limits and see what it did to my life,\u201d he told news.com.au. \u201cI was happier, and better off, not only after the experiment was over, but during as well.\n\n\u201cHaving less space clears a lot of noise in your life. I spent more time in the community and on campus. I cut my commute from 30 minutes to 30 seconds, and my rent was almost nothing.

        "text": "Professor Dumpster: \u2018You can be happy living in 33 square feet\u2019\n\nDr. Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, told RT he has a pretty normal life \u2013 he eats well, drives a decent car and has a girlfriend. The only difference is that he goes home to a recycling bin, not an ordinary house.\n\nIn early February a university professor in Austin, Texas, moved into a 33-square-foot dumpster, where he plans to live in for a year. Wilson\u2019s experiment is aimed at showing his students at Huston-Tillotson University, as well as the whole world, that people can happily live in a smaller space while lessening their impact on the environment.\n\n\u201cIn America, the average American homes are about 2,500 feet more or less, and we wanted just to see whether one can have pretty good life on a lot less. So in this case we are living in 1 percent of size of average American home and our main hypothesis is that one may have a pretty good life in much, much less,\u201d Wilson told RT.\n\nDr. Jeff Wilson, who is now known by the nickname \u201cProfessor Dumpster,\u201d is a Harvard-educated environmental science professor and dean of the University College. He managed to transform an ordinary, smelly dumpster into a comfortable accommodation with a shower, kitchen, bed, toilet and even Wi-Fi. This project turned out to be very successful and warmly welcomed by students, though Dr. Wilson didn\u2019t ask anyone to abandon their homes and join him.\n\n\u201cThis is actually a science experiment, it\u2019s an educational experiment. We wouldn\u2019t expect anybody else to be crazy enough actually to live in 33 square feet. What we hope is to show that one can have a very good life at that level,\u201d Wilson said.\n\n\u201cI think we are teaching a good lesson on living on less and some sustainability lessons here,\u201d he added.\n\nLiving in a dumpster on the campus doesn\u2019t only serve as example of a sustainable accommodation but allows Wilson to cut his expenditures on rent and saves him commuting time. The only \u201ccosts\u201d are that he sometimes gets nocturnal visits from his students when they have some questions about their homework.\n\n\u201cThe only rent I\u2019m actually paying right now is the extra 15-20 hours that I\u2019m working a week for free at the university just by communicating when the students come by night. That is probably my rent,\u201d Wilson told RT.\n\nWilson argues that he has really become much happier and is has a better life. He plans to continue the experiment for another six months at least, probably another year.\n\n\u201cWe are going to see where we will end up. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be moving back to a \u2018conventional American home\u2019 any time soon, but probably won\u2019t downsize either. When you are at the bottom, when you are at that space, you at least can feel that you have a big space, even if it is a 200-square-foot New York studio apartment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe point here is that I\u2019m living a pretty normal life, eat meat from time to time, I drive a normal car, I have a girlfriend. The only difference in my life is that instead of going home to a house, I\u2019m going home to a dumpster,\u201d Wilson said.",

For one year, the Huston-Tillotson University professor lived in a 33-square-foot renovated dumpster to teach students about science and sustainability.\n\n\"Essentially, I was just sitting there one evening thinking about all the good things about the dumpster,\" said Wilson. \"It was highly affordable, I could transport it and I got to spend a lot more time in my hood, the neighborhood I wanted to be in and I thought, 'Okay, let's take this and work on it.'\"\n\nWilson created a team to start the company Kasita.\n\n\"This is an amazing team,\" said Wilson. \"We have Robert Keith at W2 MacFab in East Austin who runs a genius shop that's one of the only places that could actually make this, and Taylor Wilson [no relation] a young developer doing micro units here in East Austin.\"\n\nKasita is a play on the Spanish word \"casita,\" which means \"little house,\" and that's exactly what Wilson's company is building. Small, pre-fabricated homes that are just 208 square feet.\n\n\"Iconically designed. It looks as beautiful as these million dollar condos down here and will rent in Austin for about $600 a month,\" said Wilson. \"This is not a dumpster. This has a walk-in shower, a queen-size bed, a desk, a table and then this beautiful glass cube in the front that brings a lot of light into the space.\"\n\nThe couch in the living room pulls out into a queen-size bed. There are storage units and closets built into the walls and a step next to the couch is actually storage for up to 50 pairs of shoes. The walls in the units are made of tiles that can be customized to hold speakers or shelves.\n\nThe units themselves fit into rack structures. Each rack can hold nine units; three across and three units high. The racks can be placed next to each other or you can fit one rack into a space as small as 1,000 square feet, such as a parking lot. And if you want to move, crews just pull your unit out of the rack and install it in another rack structure.\n\nWilson said as cool as the idea is, it's actually a solution to urban living.\n\n\"Yeah we're making a cool house. Yeah we're making a small thing that moves around, but the people of this city and the people in America can no longer afford to live in the cities that they love and that's the heart of the problem we're going after,\" Wilson said.\n\nKasita already has two lots in Downtown Austin that will be ready in 2016. By 2017, Kasita plans to expand to 10 cities across the country.",

In his 6-by-6 foot dumpster, Wilson was able to install solar power, basic cooking accommodations, a composting toilet, and a solar heated shower.\n\nWilson\u2019s goal was to prove to his students that he could live on 1% of the electricity and water the average American uses in 1% of the space.\n\nNow that the project is over, Wilson is rolling out dumpster-inspired micro homes via his new company, Kasita. This startup company builds tiny homes packed with the most advanced technologies to reduce the carbon footprints of their occupants.\n\nFrom flat screen TVs, to clothes washers, these tiny homes have all the amenities we\u2019re used to in a fraction of the space. While the median American home size is 2,467 square feet, Kasitas are 352.\n\nWhile this model is a bit different from the 6X6 original that is near and dear to our hearts here at RDD, it\u2019s difficult to forget the roots of the first Kasita microhouse.",

        "text": "'Professor Dumpster' debuting affordable Kasita housing in Austin this fall\n\nBy Casey Claiborne, FOX 7 Austin\n\nPublished July 20, 2016 5:38pm CDT\n\nDr. Jeff Wilson is the \"artist formerly known as Professor Dumpster.\" Actually he still likes being called that.\n\nIn 2014 the Huston-Tillotson Associate Professor of Biological Sciences turned a dumpster into a place to live...and he lived there for a year.\n\n\"I owned my stuff. It didn't own me. I spent more time outdoors and exploring the neighborhood, I had more disposable income,\" Wilson said.\n\nWilson says while laying in the dumpster and looking up at the stars one night, he had an idea.\n\n\"Hey...maybe there's something here. Maybe we could make something out of this experiment that could solve part of the affordability crisis that we face here in Austin,\" he said.\n\nTwo years later, Wilson is the CEO of Kasita -- a fully-realized idea that's actually happening later this year.\n\nKasita is a start-up. So they were looking for venture capital -- but....\n\n\"I'll just say that's going pretty well,\" Wilson said.\n\nBasically what we're talking about -- a structure called a \"Kasita Rack\" will be built. The rack will hold the \"Kasita Units\" that will be stacked into it.\n\nWilson says the model in East Austin is 50% smaller than what the actual units will look like.\n\n\"It is a 320 square foot mass manufactured, pre-fab, high quality, but affordable housing product,\" he said.\n\nAnd the units are mobile. So in theory, Kasita owners can move them from city to city.\n\n\"We will have a series of these racking structures that a crane will lift them in and can plug them actually into the structure,\" Wilson said.\n\nProfessor Dumpster says the beta version or \"model 1\" of the Kasita system is under construction now in the Austin area. It's expected to make its debut this fall.\n\nFrom there, Wilson hopes to build Kasitas around the world.\n\n\"In the case let's say the city wanted to provide affordable housing to teachers and firefighters and police officers. Those folks could own a home and park it on city property so that we were insuring that those real foundations of what makes up Austin were able to afford a place to live,\" Wilson said.\n\nDr. Wilson says the Kasita units will go on sale this fall.\n\nHe's coy about how much they will cost but insists they'll be more affordable than what people typically pay for rent here in the Austin area.\n\nAnd no property taxes...so in theory once it's paid off you just pay your utility bill.",

Then an instructor with the Ann Richards School will dive in.\n\nThe \"Home School\" program is not just for teachers \u2013 students can sign up, too.",

Huston Tillotson University professor Joshua Wilson, is living in a 33-square-foot dumpster on campus for a year-long experiment dubbed Project Dumpster.\n\nAs part of the project, Professor Dumpster will be tracking his water and energy usage to establish a baseline comparison point. He'll also be giving talks at local schools and has received enthusiastic drawings from students, which he's displaying inside the dumpster.\n\nWilson said that living in the dumpster is surprisingly comfortable, and he's been able to acclimate to temperatures up to 81 degrees Fahrenheit. However, he acknowledges that it may be challenging to maintain this level of comfort during Texas' triple-digit summers.\n\nThe project has brought attention to Huston Tillotson University, which was previously overshadowed by the nearby University of Texas at Austin. Wilson believes that his experiment can provide valuable lessons on design and building dense housing for cities like Austin, potentially solving transportation and energy problems.\n\nWilson's approach is unconventional but open-ended, with no set deadlines or blueprints for what a dumpster home should look like. He said, \"We're thoughtfully playing...to where we don't have hard design deadlines or carved-in-stone blueprints for what a dumpster home would look like. It's an evolution.\"",

        "text": "'Professor Dumpster' Shakes Up Austin Housing, One Micro-Unit At A Time\n\nEast Austin professor uses his own experiences to create affordable housing in tiny houses \u2014 or micro-units.\n\nKayla Stewart,\nPatch Staff\nPosted Fri, Oct 9, 2015 at 11:48 am CT\n|\nUpdated Fri, Oct 9, 2015 at 4:33 pm CT\n\nWhat was a small experiment has morphed into a movement to push affordable housing in Austin.\n\nProfessor Jeff Wilson, eloquently called \u201cProfessor Dumpster,\u201d is changing the way Austin builds its apartment units.\n\nAfter becoming bored with the traditional grind of the academia world, the Huston-Tillotson University senior advisor lived in a 33-square-foot renovated dumpster to teach his students about science and sustainability.\n\n\u201cI was publishing dozens of papers [at Harvard], getting promoted, doing what I need to do in academia,\u201d Wilson told Patch. \u201cI realized that my students weren\u2019t really engaged or interested. With the creation of this dumpster home, I was not only communicating with my students but also to broader public. Putting a comfortable home and a dirty dumpster into one gets folks talking.\u201d\n\nWilson expanded on the dumpster idea and moved towards a \u201cmicrounit\u201d project. Along with several other designers and innovaters, he started a company called Kasita, a startup that addresses Austin housing inequality by creating tiny, affordable housing.\n\nKasita, a play on the Spanish word \u201ccasita,\u201d which means \u201clittle house,\u201d is what Wilson\u2019s company is using to make this company real. Wilson and his team create homes that are only 208 square feet, yet include all of the necessary amenities for the average apartment owner.\n\n\u201cI started thinking about the best parts of the dumpster. By living smaller and being more nimble, I was able to have freedom to move my house wherever I wanted, while also having a short term lease. I could own stuff rather than it owning me. I started thinking about what if we made something bigger than a dumpster, but made it micro. I wanted to keep it nimble enough where you could move it as you would a dumpster. I literally created a \u2019dumpster baby\u2019.\u201d\n\nWilson\u2019s has a stellar team to help the company grow. Elon Musk\u2019s head industrial designer at Solar City, W2 MacFab\u2019s Robert Keith, and micro-unit developer Taylor Wilson all make up Wilson\u2019s dream team, and help make the innovative project a reality.\n\nThe living room couch pulls out into a queen-size bed, storage units and closets are built into the walls, and a step next to the couch serves a dual purpose by also storing up to 50 pairs of shoes. The walls in the units are made of tiles that can hold speakers and shelves, and the units themselves can fit into rack structures. Each rack holds up to nine units, and you can fit one rack into an area as small as 1,000 feet.\n\nKasita has two lots in Downtown Austin that will be ready by 2016. By 2017, Kasita plans to expand to 10 cities across the country.\n\n[Photo: Kasita]",

While 33 square feet might be sufficient for sleeping and storing clothes, it's unlikely that this small space could accommodate all the necessities of modern life such as a shower, toilet, kitchen, and other amenities. This experiment aims to determine how much square footage is actually needed for a single person to live comfortably.\n\nThe original Tumbleweed homes had living spaces as small as 84 square feet with an added loft, while the Tumbleweed XS was only 65 square feet plus a loft. The back of a full-size American van measures between 40 and 48 square feet, making it seem like a better choice than a dumpster-sized box for living quarters.\n\nSome commenters view this as a creative idea that may one day become a luxury apartment in the future, while others see it as an experiment to find a more practical solution. The post includes links to YouTube videos and a call to action to list tiny homes for sale or rent, with a note that the website disclaims any responsibility for verifying the accuracy of information provided.\n\nOverall, this article discusses the potential living arrangements in tiny houses and encourages readers to think creatively about what constitutes a comfortable space.",

Take a tour of his unconventional, eclectic home.\n\nThe Dumpster Project \u2014 an ongoing project spearheaded by Jeffrey Wilson, an associate professor of biological sciences and dean of the University College at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin \u2013 aims to see how humans can live in a comfortable but environmentally sustainable fashion.\n\n\"If you think about just moving to a smaller space and having less stuff, it creates some voids or spaces in your life that you can fill up with more meaningful stuff, meaningful experiences,\" said Wilson, who has been nicknamed \"Professor Dumpster.\"\n\nThe project began in February when Wilson retrofitted the 36-square-foot dumpster into his own minimalist living space with the aim of seeing how humans can minimize physical possessions reduce their energy and water use along with their waste production yet live comfortably.\n\nWilson said he spends at least five nights a week in the dumpster. Other nights, students and couch surfers lounge in the space. Students use installed sensors to track data such as CO2 levels and temperature to determine how to adjust conditions to human needs.\n\nWilson said he plans to expand the project in February with a second dumpster. The professor plans to experiment with solar power and energy generated by a bicycle. He also plans to dump his Volvo for a bicycle come February.\n\nBut Wilson, now 10 months into the experiment, said he finds living with less has improved his life: for example, because the dumpster is located on the Huston-Tillotson University campus in East Austin, he has managed to significantly cut down his commute time and avoid the maddening Austin gridlock.\n\n\"That's actually been the most surprising aspect of the project is that my life's actually a lot better now than before we started the project,\" Wilson said.\n\nWilson continued, \"The thing that happens when you move into a bit of a smaller state is that you spend more time out in society and out in the community and interacting with people.\"",

        "text": "Professor takes up residence in dumpster for a year\n\nHow far would you go for the good of the environment? Perhaps you recycle or ride a bicycle to work instead of taking the car to do your bit but would you consider moving into a dumpster for a year? That is just what Dr Jeff Wilson from the Huston-Tillotson University decided to do; take an old dumpster, transform it and then live in it for a whole year.\n\nProject Dumpster aims to investigate sustainable living practices as the population is forever increasing while space and resources are decreasing. The dumpster chosen for the project is 33 square feet and Dr Wilson says that it should make people consider what can be done with less space. He hopes that the project will encourage people to talk about it along with bringing out other ideas on the topic.\n\nOf course as he is going to live in it for a year, he had to make sure that there would be enough living space and so, many modifications were made to it. The dumpster has been prepared firstly by being cleaned out thoroughly and then rust proofed. In order for it to offer some degree of warmth it needed insulation and then thought was given to hanging a clothes line for drying clothes along with making a rain garden.\n\nOf course there was the essential installation of a toilet and a false floor was added into the box for storage. Solar panels provide sustainable electrical energy which of course doesn\u2019t come with the monthly bill. The \u201csmall home\u201d was also given a weather station, air conditioning, pitched roof, its own mailbox and locks. The pockets of the dumpster were sealed to ensure that it could not be mistaken for a trash receptacle that was in use.\n\nWilson also provided the interior with some furnishings. He moved into his new home in February of this year and he will be living in it for a year at least.",

The professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, sold his belongings and in February moved into a used trash Dumpster 36 square feet in size.\n\nWilson is documenting his progress on the website dumpsterproject.org, using videos and social media to showcase his sustainable living project. \u201cIt\u2019s really just to explore the idea of less,\u201d he told ABC station KTRK in Houston.\n\nStudents, who helped clean the Dumpster before Wilson moved in, were stunned when he announced his plan. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at all,\u201d student Charles Deshaw said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re really going to live in a Dumpster?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe front door slides shut. It\u2019s cold at night. The walls contain decorative hangings. The home features few appliances such as a washer and dryer, which were added during the current phase of his project. The third and final phase will feature solar panels with a focus on renewable energy.\n\nFor Wilson \u2014 who goes by the nickname \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d \u2014 the second night in the Dumpster was scariest. \u201cThe trash man came by and picked up two of my neighbors,\u201d Wilson told KTRK.\n\nLuckily, Wilson\u2019s new home remained untouched by trash crews. After living in the Dumpster for six months, Wilson is proud of the discourse his experiment has encouraged and that it has promoted the idea of living with less. It\u2019s important to \u201cfoster a conversation and keep that conversation going. We don\u2019t know where that conversation is going to lead,\u201d Wilson told KTRK.",

Find out why on Earth he\u2019s doing it.\nStaff Writers\n3 min read\nJuly 8, 2014 - 5:00PM\n\nCOULD you spend a year in a dumpster, all in the name of science?\nThat\u2019s what Jeff Wilson, environmental science professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is doing.\n\nProfessor Wilson is transforming a tiny 33-square-foot rubbish bin, which is about 1 per cent of the size of the average American home, into one of the world\u2019s most sustainable tiny houses.\n\nWith the help of his students and environmental experts, Prof Wilson wants to prove that humans can happily live with less and minimise our environmental impact.\n\n\u201cHow do we equip current and future generations with the tools they need for sustainable living practices?\u201d Prof Wilson asks in a mini-documentary about The Dumpster Project.\n\n\u201cThis [project] is to test, to the absolute limit, whether you can be happy and healthy in a very small space,\u201d he said.\n\nAlmost three years ago, when the lease to his apartment ran out, Prof Wilson posted on Facebook:\n\n\u201cStarting at 6pm, I will be selling all of my home furnishings, clothes, kitchen appliances, and everything else in the apartment for $1 an item.\u201d\n\nHe then secretly spent the next seven months sleeping on the floor of his work office, all the while getting the dumpster ready to live in.\n\nAfter giving it a good clean, Prof Wilson turned the big bin into a small version of a typical home. It was scant living at first, with water being lugged up all the way from the local lake every few days. But things progressed quickly, and just yesterday, Prof Wilson gave the shell\u2019s interior a lick of paint, and picked a \u201cfull selection of ripe and sweet baby tomatoes, collard greens, okra and various herbs\u201d from the so-called Dumpster Garden.\n\nPhase two and three of the design will see a shower, toilet, multiple stories, and appliances like a washing machine, dryer, and a hot water heater introduced, all of which will use 1 per cent of the energy an average American home uses.\n\nMore: See the latest floor plans here",

        "text": "Here is the extracted article:\n\n\"The landscapes of love are many and varied,\" writes Austin writer Clara Bensen, whose own love landscape is a 36-square-foot dumpster her boyfriend lives in. Her bae, environmental science professor Jeff Wilson, has taken upon himself the name Professor Dumpster and spent the last year living in a dumpster that he and his students have slowly been converting into a slightly more livable dumpster. This week, in Salon, she answers the most pressing question underpinning this innovative experiment in adaptive reuse and pared-down living: what's it like to \"fool around\" in there?\n\nWhat it's like to \"fool around\" in there is \"more complicated than it used to be\":\n\n\"When it comes to privacy, our choices are often limited to the occasional house visit and the dumpster, which is usually parked a few feet behind the women's residence hall. We regularly get asked if we've done the deed in the dumpster. For the sake of Jeff's position, all I'm at liberty to say is discreet passion is (almost) impossible in a thin metal box where one careless sigh can inform the entire neighborhood on the finer points of our recreational activity.\"\n\nDiscreet passion: almost, but not quite impossible within a tricked-out garbage receptacle. Professor Jeff Dumpster also spends the rare night at her house, but he \"feels guilty\" there, \"almost like he's cheating.\" He doesn't even keep a spare toothbrush there.\n\nBensen allows that their setup is \"one of the more peculiar ones around,\" but it stays \"vibrant and loving\u2014due, in no small part, to the fact that we're flexible and we welcome the strange and curious. We still want each other after all these wild months. We're still slow to say goodnight.\"",

Professor Dumpster is after all a teacher, and this year-long experiment is a chance for his students to design, build and test the bin with the goal of taking it from a garbage can to a home. \u201cThe idea here is to ultimately show one can have a pretty good life in a dumpster,\" Wilson told Fast Company.\n\nThe first phase of the project is to outfit the tiny space to have many of the creature comforts of a modern home: shower, kitchen, bed, WiFi and toilet. After that, the goal is to design the space to be as energy efficient as possible in order to reduce its environmental impact (think things like solar panels and energy producing toilets).\n\nFor times when the professor just needs to get out of the trash can, students can opt to stay overnight in the dumpster. As one HT student told KVUE, she's already excited to spend a night in the bin. \"I think it's pretty intriguing,\" said Evette Jackson. \"It's pretty cool. I want to live in it too.\"\n\nAfter his year of living in 6 feet by 6 feet is up, Wilson plans on taking the bin across the country to teach students about the possibility of living outside the box while living, well, inside a box.\n\nYou can follow Professor Dumpster's latest adventures on The Dumpster Project blog.",

        "text": "Could you live simpler? Could you live in a dumpster?\nDr. Jeff Wilson, sometimes affectionately called \u201cProfessor Dumpster,\u201d is dean of the University College and associate professor of Biological Sciences at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, and his Dumpster Project has already proven that the answer to both questions is \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nWhat I should have specified when I asked the second question is that the dumpster you\u2019d be living in would be pretty nice inside, like a tiny apartment. Just with no kitchen or toilet or shower\u2026yet. Still, it would be a first-class receptacle. Way better than most. In fact, there wouldn\u2019t be much actual trash even in the thing, unless you finished off a bag of chips in there or something. And you\u2019d never have to worry about any guys in a big truck coming to pour you out in the morning.\n\nSo what do you think now? Could you live in such a dumpster as this, which is only entering Phase II of its development? Phase III, \u201cThe \u00dcber Dumpster,\u201d will be less like a dumpster and more like just a really small home. It will also be yet another innovative model of sustainable living\u2014something to be proud of, even if there\u2019s no room to have a couch in there too.\n\nWhen humans have to do things because they feel they\u2019ve got no viable other choices, they find that they can live through some pretty extreme extremes. Consider, for instance, all the homeless people in the world who have little more than a newspaper to cover them. Compared to the worst of their sleeping situations, life in a dumpster the way Dr. Jeff Wilson does it is clearly doable.\n\nAs a kid, I was a lover of fort-building. I made them small because I didn\u2019t have all day. I wanted to be done before the woods were too dark for me to enjoy my new stronghold. And once I\u2019d built a fort, whether out of old junk and plywood or just by expanding an already-existing ditch and covering it with sticks and grass, I usually just moved on to the next. I wasn\u2019t actually trying to live in these things, though I know that the idea of living in them \u2014 the idea that I might at least spend a night in one \u2014 was part of the fun I got out of building them.\n\nSuch an idea may even be tied to evolutionary drives concerning habitat and offspring.\n\nNow that I\u2019m older, I\u2019m sure I still wouldn\u2019t mind building a fort every now and then, but the dream would probably be to have more of a Batcave, as in Batman\u2019s Batcave. As in, I would be Batman, the Dark Knight, in my Batcave. Silly, I know. I also know that I don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d a Batcave. I want one. And I\u2019m not the only person who does.\n\nThe cities and suburbs of the future will have to change to accommodate a lot more people, a lot more people wanting \u201cBatcaves.\u201d Technology will find plenty of ways to get us what we want as well as what we need, but if the goal of the world is to provide a pleasant, sustainable future for all of its humans, then a bigger focus \u2014 at least at first \u2014 should probably be put on the needs of everybody rather than the wants of a few.\n\nThe website for The Dumpster Project asks these two questions right up front: \u201cWhat does home look like in a world of 10 billion people? How do we equip current and future generations with the tools they need for sustainable living practices?\u201d The project is working toward answers for these questions. And, though I still wouldn\u2019t mind having a Batcave, I know that we humans could do a lot worse than following the progress and practices of Professor Dumpster.",

        "text": "Out of the Dumps\nBy Kimya Kavehkar\nPublished: February 19, 2015\n\nWe featured Huston-Tillotson environmental science professor Jeff Wilson as a \u201cCharacter\u201d in our January 2014 issue, just as he was about to embark on his ambitious project of living in a dumpster for exactly one year. Wilson officially moved out on Feb. 4 after successfully completing his sustainable and minimalist experiment.\n\nWhat are the top three things you took away from the experience of living in a dumpster?\n\nOne would be the joy that spending more time engaging with the community around you brings into your life. When you live in such a small space, it\u2019s not super comfortable all the time, so I just spent more time around campus\u2014I spent more time walking around the community interacting with folks, not cooped up in my home.\n\nThe second was all of the benefits of living in a smaller space. I can name them for hours, but things like lower rent, living in the area you would like to live in, lower utilities, less time spent cleaning the house, all of those things you just take as givens. When you really compress the stuff that you have and the space that you have, you\u2019re able to cut out a lot of the noise.\n\nIt\u2019s also just kind of keeping life interesting, keeping you on your toes. With a radical personal experiment like this you really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and it\u2019s pretty rare these days that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. We get a few curveballs along the way, but for a middle-aged man like myself, most stuff is generally mapped out. It\u2019s nice to have some magic. It\u2019s nice to have some surprises.\n\nDid you feel sad or relieved when you moved out?\n\nI cried like a baby. I seriously did, I have it on video. They were real tears. It really was my home.\n\nYou said the highest temp in the dumpster was 130 degrees and the lowest was 23 degrees. How did you deal with the elements?\n\nI got used to the conditions; you just don\u2019t spend as much time in there in the middle of the day. Sleeping through there in the night is easier to do in the cold if you have the right technology; I was always able to have a warm sleeping bag.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve moved out, what\u2019s going to happen to the dumpster?\n\nI want to be very clear that it\u2019s not actually the end of the project. The dumpster will become a community art space for the city.\n\nWhat are your plans after moving out of the dumpster?\n\nI\u2019m planning on doing some travel and possibly some writing.\n\nYou recently went on a romantic date across Europe with a woman you met online. What do you think about that experience?\n\nI think it was great! I think that was just another sort of small radical personal experiment, this one happened to end up yielding a girlfriend that would stay with me through the whole year of living in a dumpster.\n\nYou have a book and movie deal based on your travel experiences. What do you think about that?\n\nI think it\u2019s great! I think that was just another sort of small radical personal experiment, this one happened to end up yielding a girlfriend that would stay with me through the whole year of living in a dumpster.\n\nWho would you pick to play you in the movie?\n\nIs Robert Downey Jr. too old? Yeah, maybe him. I know that Shailene Woodley has expressed interest [in the movie], too.\n\nSo, are you still going to call yourself Professor Dumpster?\n\nWell, I may have to come up with a symbol and call myself the Artist Formerly Known As Professor Dumpster.",

The pre-fabricated homes can be constructed in three weeks \u2014 and could go a long way toward easing the affordable housing crunch that has bedeviled much of the country.\n\nWith the help of former employees at Google, Elon Musk's SolarCity and Bell Helicopter, Wilson thinks he has a solution to provide homes and stackable apartments in unused pieces of land such as vacant parking lots. \"If you file for a backyard unit, it can be approved in weeks,\" says Wilson, who predicts his homes could hit the market this summer.\n\n\"We need to find cracks in the system rather than take a sledgehammer to it,\" he says.\n\nIf the reaction of consumers at Kasita's recent party at SXSW is any indication, interest is high. Hundreds patiently waited in line to get a peek at the modular home, which features a bathroom/shower, kitchen, bedroom and living room patio.\n\nA remote control allows dwellers to quickly change mood lighting and an entertainment system. Date mode finds Marvin Gaye's smooth voice filling the small living area. Storage space is built into steps, walls and other nooks and crannies.\n\nThe 21-person start-up, based here, is not only espousing the mantra that small is beautiful, but it can be environmental and profitable. Wilson says several mayors are interested in the homes, and he intends to visit California to make his pitch this month.\n\n\"Green is the new black,\" Wilson says.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.",

We're trying to show that you can live comfortably and affordably in a small space.\n\n\"We've made some modifications to make it habitable,\" Professor Wilson explained. \"It's not luxurious, but it's cozy.

        "text": "Professor Agrees to Live in Dumpster for an Entire Year\n\nWhile the average American home continues to get better and use more resources, one Austin, TX college professor is taking part in an experiment to cut way back \u2014 to just one percent. Jeffrey Wilson, affectionately known as Professor Dumpster, moved into a dumpster on Huston-Tillotson University campus back in March to prove to his students and the community that you can have a good life while using only 1% of the water and energy used by the average American household.\n\nAt first, Wilson was essentially camping in this dumpster, getting water from the town lake, using candlelight, and storing his very few belongings in a false plywood floor. In August, he entered Phase II of the project. They were able to equip the dumpster with air conditioning just in time for Texas heat of August. In this phase, the dumpster will be hooked up to the electrical grid and afforded many amenities of the modern home such as bedding, cooking supplies, solar lighting, and an improved roof.\n\nPhase III, called The \u00dcber Dumpster, will kick off in Spring 2015. In this phase, the team plans to combine the best of the first two phases \u2014 using modern amenities while creating the smallest ecological footprint possible. Design ideas for Phase III include a composting toilet, solar-heated shower, and a flat screen television.\n\nTo keep up to date with Professor Dumpster and the HT Green is the New BlackTM student organization, check out the website.",

        "text": "What Do We Really Need?\n\nThis question came to mind as I read about Professor Jeff Wilson and The Dumpster Project. A dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, Wilson embarked on an experiment to see if it was possible to live in a 36-square-foot dumpster.\n\nOver time, he\u2019s gone from sleeping on cardboard mats to adding custom touches like a sliding roof and an air conditioner. He sums up his sustainability experiment this way:\n\n\u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve shared before the idea of living a more minimalist life, but some of those stories have focused on the concept of a number. What\u2019s the smallest number of items I can own? Professor Wilson\u2019s story made me refocus on the idea of what items do we really need?\n\nWhat makes this perspective so interesting is that the answer varies by individual. It\u2019s incredibly personal and, I believe, an incredibly powerful process.\n\nThe goal isn\u2019t to get down to a number, but to better understand why we have what we have in our lives. In many ways, it goes back to the idea of buying good, quality items and owning them for a long time. If you aren\u2019t buying everything you see in the store, it becomes much more realistic to buy durable items that we really value and would otherwise be \u201ctoo expensive.\u201d\n\nA friend of mine recently moved into a new home. It\u2019s a larger place than she was in before, and because she\u2019s not married and doesn\u2019t have kids, people keep asking, \u201cWhat do you need all that space for?\u201d\n\nIt turns out that for her, it was about location. Homes rarely come up for sale in the area she wanted to live.\n\nHowever, because she knows it\u2019s a real risk that she\u2019ll fill up the house if she\u2019s not careful, she\u2019s adopted a one in, one out rule. For everything new she wants to bring into the house, something old needs to go out.\n\nSome of you probably follow this rule too, and like Professor Wilson\u2019s experiment, it goes back to this idea of thoughtful consumption.\n\nWhat do we really need? Are we buying things thoughtfully or carelessly? I believe our willingness to look at our buying behavior can have a huge impact on whether we reach the goals that we say matter most to us.\n\nIf we get busy filling up our lives with things we don\u2019t need, it\u2019s easy to get distracted. So this weekend, I have a challenge for you.\n\nTake a look at your possessions and identify three things you consider necessities in your life. Then, take a look around at the rest of your stuff. If you had to give up everything else you own to keep those three items, could you? Or does something else start to look more important?\n\nBy the end of this experiment, you\u2019ll have a much better idea of how to answer the question, \u201cWhat do I really need?\u201d",

        "text": "The Ultimate Tiny Home Is In A Dumpster (PHOTOS)\n\nBy Samantha Toscano\nJuly 6, 2014, 11:20 AM EDT\n\n|Updated July 6, 2014\n\nFor the past several months, Huston-Tillotson University's environmental science professor Jeff Wilson has been living small in a dumpster. The self-proclaimed \"Professor Dumpster\" has been living in what he calls the \"magic boxes\" most people see as nothing more than a place to put their garbage. His motivation? With the help of his students, Wilson wants to take a new approach to the way single-family homes use their resources by maintaining his lifestyle in a sustainable 33-square-foot abode that's roughly 1 percent of the average-sized American house.\n\nBut his project doesn't quite end there. Over the next six months, Wilson and his team will transform the trash bin into a small version of a typical home before remodeling it to maximize sustainability with features such as solar power and a \"green toilet.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re going to take all of the lessons we\u2019ve learned from this about design and living in small spaces and we\u2019re going to build the tiniest home to code in the city of Austin,\" Wilson says. \"We want to develop a \u2018how to\u2019 for building the tiniest home possible.\"",

        "text": "Most nights I'd just stare at the dumpster ceiling,\u201d Wilson recalls, \u201cAnd one night I had the first of two 'a-ha' moments. The first was realizing that smaller spaces could mean better lives. My stuff didn't own me anymore. I had more income. I could pick up and move my dumpster to another great part of town any time I wanted.\u201d\n\nWilson's second a-ha moment was realizing that there were existing stigmas surrounding \"micro housing\". When you say the word \"pre-manufactured\" most people think of a mobile home, not a tech-stacked, high-design living pod. If you tell my wife a loft has a \"Murphy bed\" the answer will simply be \"no\"\u2014because no one, especially my wife, wants to spend ten minutes manually erecting a bed when they just want to go to sleep.\n\n\"I realized that whatever Kasita was going to be,\" Wilson recalls, \"It couldn't be a dumpster. It had to be beautiful. It had to be iconic. It had to turn the concept of a home into a brand like a car or a watch.\"\n\nWhen Wilson climbed out of his dumpster in early 2015, the first person he met with was a former Apple patent attorney, who told Wilson to surround himself with people who knew more than him. As a result, one of Wilson's first partners was an industrial designer, because he knew that he couldn't reinvent real estate through architecture alone.\n\n\"I told him, 'I want you to design an iPhone that I can live in that's like a Tesla to drive',\" Wilson remembers of their first meeting. \"I want you to throw out everything you know about housing\u2014and he didn't know much\u2014and make something truly iconic.\"\n\nThe result is 320 square feet of smart-home technology and voice-controlled systems (with 10' ceilings) that can fine tune your interior temperature or dim the \u201cdynamic\u201d glass at night for privacy on command. The robotic kitchen module transforms into a sleek, comfortable queen bed over a mobile app while you\u2019re on your way home.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just make Kasita 'smart',\" Wilson explains, \"We wanted people to just talk to the walls.\"\n\nWilson\u2019s other goal with Kasita was to build something that could be infinitely scalable for cities and developers that are struggling to provide attainable housing. The obvious targets are cities like San Francisco and Manhattan, where the whole concept of \u201creasonable housing\u201d is a laughable economic oxymoron.\n\nOther markets include providing seasonal housing in ski towns, corporate campus housing for employees or interns (think Google), and housing for school districts who can\u2019t attract new teachers due to high local rents. Wilson has already met with over two dozen mayors and Kasita \"communities\" are now in the works with developers in over a dozen US cities including Chicago, Houston, Brooklyn, San Francisco, San Diego, and Atlanta.\n\n\u201cIt you really think about it,\" Wilson says, recalling another one of his nights in the dumpster, \"There's been no disruption to the way we build or how we live for the last 150 years. There's a zeitgeist now happening in how people look at this, and it\u2019s tapping into other disruptive parts of the sharing economy like Uber and Lyft as well as companies like AirBNB.\n\nThe kind of model that Kasita represents hasn\u2019t even begun to tap into the changes occurring in the real estate and development space.\u201d\n\nSo what's it cost to buy your own Kasita? Wilson is still keeping that under wraps until this fall when the first buyers can start putting down deposits.",

The pseudonym Professor Dumpster is based upon his role as part of 'The Dumpster Project', an educational and minimalist living experiment that transformed a trash dumpster into a fully sustainable home. Wilson lived in the dumpster over the course of the yearlong project.\n\nWilson is currently CEO and Co-Founder at the startup company Kasita. Kasita builds micro smart homes that are capable of stacking. Kasita was named one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies and won a SXSW Interactive Innovation Award.\n\nWilson is the Chairman and Founder of the 501(c)3 non-profit 'The Dumpster Project', a STEM educational experiment in which he moved into an empty dumpster and transformed it into a 33 square feet (3.1 m2) environmentally sustainable home. The project has been featured in a variety of local and national news sources.\n\nTogether with freelance writer Clara Bensen, Wilson performed the 'travel experiment' No Baggage, in which they traveled for 21 days through eight countries with no change of clothes shortly after meeting on a dating website.\n\nSubsequent to moving out of the dumpster, Wilson, launched a project entitled '99 Nights ATX' in which he aimed to spend 99 nights in 99 different homes across Austin, gaining an up-close and intimate understanding of how Austinites relate to their home spaces. The project is in collaboration with writer Clara Bensen.\n\nWilson was formerly dean of the University College and an associate professor at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas. He did post-doctoral work at Harvard, holds a PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Canterbury and is the recipient of a University of Texas Systems' Regents' Outstanding Teaching Award, the largest monetary teaching award in the United States.",

        "text": "Professor Moving Out Of Dumpster: Texas Man Ends Experiment After One Year\n\nBy Regina Avalos\nPublished on: 01:44 PST, Feb 7, 2015\n\nA Texas professor is moving out of the dumpster he called home for a year. As a part of an experiment and teaching lesson, Dr. Jeff Wilson lived for one year inside a dumpster. According to KSL, the East Austin man left the dumpster he called home on Wednesday, and it was not an easy departure.\n\nOne would think leaving a home that is just 36-square feet would be a reason to celebrate, but Wilson admitted that he shed a few tears on his last night. He spoke about how he felt this week with the local media.\n\u201cThe last few nights have been really sweet. Identitywise, am I still Professor Dumpster if I\u2019m not living in a dumpster? I don\u2019t know if this is what my mom wanted for her first-born son.\u201d\nProfessor Dumpster is the nickname he earned because of the experiment. His dumpster started off as just a plain trash can, but over the year he and his students added to it. By the end of the year, the dumpster had a \u201cwindow air-conditioning unit, storage under a false floor, a sliding roof with a weather station that takes measurements every five minutes.\u201d\nWilson even painted the walls an eggshell color, and he put up some art on the walls of the dumpster. He also had a small electric heater.\n\nDuring the past year, he spent 250 nights inside the dumpster. The nights he spent away from it were spent with his daughter or his girlfriend at her home. Asking his girlfriend to spend the night with him for a bit of romance and breakfast in bed in the morning was out of the question.\n\nAt the start of the year, Wilson had a clear plan in mind. He wanted to show that people could live a \u201cpretty good life in and on a lot less.\u201d He feels like he succeeded with his experiment. Over the past year, he had \u201cmore moments\u201d with less stuff.\n\nThe dumpster will still have a use in the days and months to come. It will act as the center of an educational project.\nAccording to KHOU, Wilson said, \u201c[W]e are launching what we call a dumpster home school. So under that effort teachers and educators can spend a night in here. Walk home, back to the classroom with curriculum on sustainability about living on less.\u201d\nStudents will have the task of turning to the trash dumpster into a home. Students that stayed in the dumpster already did have one complaint, and that is the dumpster\u2019s weak Wi-Fi signal. Wilson hopes to change that in the future. He revealed that his dream is to have Google Fiber for the dumpster.\n\nDr. Jeff Wilson has already decided on his next project, and it will not involve a trash can in any way. He is moving up to homes, but the homes won\u2019t be his own. He will spend 99 nights in 99 different homes in Austin. KSL described the plan.\n\u201cThe new project, called 99 Nights ATX, will continue his exploration of the contemporary notion of house and home in Austin, in conventional and unconventional spaces \u2014 not to mention determine where he\u2019s going to live next. It helps that he has just a handful of shirts and a few pairs of shoes \u2014 enough to fit in a bag as he schleps around town, usually on his bike.\u201d\nWith this experiment, he wants to learn a \u201ccomprehensive view of the stories people tell themselves about home.\u201d",

His students, the Dumpster Team, and Wilson will transform the garbage container into a sustainable house and interactive teaching lab over the next year starting in Fall 2013.\n\nUpon completion, the mobile lab will tour the United States helping K-12 children understand the need for sustainability in our culture. The college students who participate in the Dumpster Project will challenge their knowledge in math, science, engineering and technology with the far reaching goal of implementing sustainability in their own life.\n\nCategories: Education",

        "text": "Austin architects unveil plans for rare pediatric respite and hospice facility\n\nAbbey House will take some strain off the caregivers for medically fragile children. Rendering courtesy of Michael Hsu Office Of Architecture\n\nFew people want to think about the end of a child's life, but pediatric care is a need nonetheless \u2014 and it's an underserved one. According to Children's Respite Homes in America, as of 2023, there were only six of such homes in the United States, which makes the plans unveiled at the August 24 Abbey Lights Up COTA Gala incredibly unique.\n\nMichael Hsu Office Of Architecture, one of the most popular firms in Austin thanks to its work with hospitality brands like P. Terry's, Uchi, the South Congress Hotel, and many more, attended the gala to show off its first envisioning of Abbey House, one of the original goals of the Abigail E. Keller (AEK) Foundation. The first of its kind in Central Texas, Abbey House will serve as a pediatric respite and hospice facility, meaning that it will provide full-time care to children at various stages of their illness, giving family members a chance to catch up on life outside of medical settings.\n\nBecause there were so few examples to base the work on, the Michael Hsu team has an opportunity to create a new standard for this type of care. They worked with local specialists to combine the two main needs.\n\n\u201cWhat we have found is that the design has to find balance between two potentially conflicting concepts \u2013 respite and hospice,\u201d said Dr. Patrick M. Jones of Dell Children's Medical Center in a press release. He's the section chief of pediatric palliative care.\n\n\u201cThe teams are presented with the challenge of creating a welcoming, open space for respite, as well as cozy and private space for those navigating end of life care,\" he continued. \"Not to mention creating a facility that ensures all aspects of the building make medically fragile children feel welcome and that they belong there, past just feeling accommodated for.\"\n\nThere is only one public rendering available so far. It shows a large, airy room with a sloped ceiling and large windows constituting what looks like an entirely glass wall. With lots of natural wood finishes, it looks out into a calming yard enclosed by greenery, including trees and a trellis for flowers. The interior makes space for playing and reading, and mobility aids are afforded wide paths through.\n\n\"Our vision is to craft a serene and welcoming environment ... to provide a calming retreat for hospice families while simultaneously sparking joy and imagination in children staying for respite services\" said Michael Hsu architect Brian Carville. \"This balance of tranquility and whimsy will set a new benchmark in pediatric respite and hospice care, enriching the lives of children and their families in Texas.\u201d\n\nThe AEK Foundation is the annual benefactor of the gala at the Circuit of the Americas, now in its sixth year. The foundation's goal since the start was to build this facility, but in the meantime it's used incoming financial support to purchase care packages for children entering the Dell At Home hospice program, equipment for procedures at the Dell Comprehensive Care Clinic, hire specialists, and more.\n\nMichael Hsu Architecture got involved through its Design for All program, which selects annual nonprofit partners to receive pro bono design work. Emergency foster care shelter Central Texas Table of Grace is the partner for 2024, and AEK is the honorary partner. The gala was hosted by The Daytripper host and executive producer Chet Garner, with live music by Suede.\n\n\"It\u2019s important to understand the reason a facility like Abbey House is needed is that the system is not set up to support this right now,\u201d said Dr. Jones. \u201cTo overcome the barriers to open a facility like this requires a ton of work and upfront help from the community. The only way this becomes successful is if this becomes an Austin and a Texas project, not just an AEK project. It's a community task to care for the most vulnerable in our community and this Foundation is doing that work.\"\n\nMore information about the Abigail E.

He's still in the first phase \u2013 or the camping out portion \u2013 of his three phase project. That means no electricity as we hover around 100 degrees.\n\nIn October we first told you about Professor Jeff Wilson's plans to live in a dumpster for a year. Wilson moved in to his dumpster digs nearly four months later. Now 5-months into phase one of his sustainability project, Wilson is eager to show off some dumpster home amenities.\n\n\"We've added what you might call a crawl in closet where we've got all of our clothes and some of our bedding there,\" said Doctor Jeff Wilson. Wilson is an environmental science professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University.\n\nBut he's most proud of two things \u2013 the first usable garden at Huston-Tillotson in nearly 5-decades. He keeps it freshly watered with the condensation that drips from a nearby AC unit. Then it's his crowning accomplishment to date \u2013 a weather station complete with antenna.\n\n\"It's probably the first weather station that's been strapped to a dumpster,\" said Wilson.\n\nNow you would expect the weather station to be able to measure the temperature both the inside and outside the dumpster. What you might not be aware of is that it also measures the moisture content into Wilson's garden. Talk about your ground control to Major Tom. But 5-months in a dumpster have not been without problems.\n\n\"That heavy rain that we had last week... when you start getting a bit more horizontal rain my basement flooded,\" said Wilson. \"I had about an inch of rain and it was time to get the Wet Vac out.\"\n\nAnd of course there's the heat.\n\n\"I have a gauge set up that I can see that fails at 120 (degrees),\" said Wilson. \"It failed the other day. I think the interior temperature the record we're up to 124 [degrees], so I don't hang out here much as you can imagine during the day during July. It has been a cool summer, but it hasn't been a cool dumpster summer.\"\n\nPhase two -- with electricity and AC -- begins next month.\n\nGo here for a link to the dumpster project website.",

He may even continue living in the dumpster for another year if he feels like continuing with the much simpler life - which he claims to prefer.\n\nMr Wilson, who is dean of the University College at Huston-Tillotson in Texas, USA, said the toughest part of his challenge was dealing with the temperature inside the dumpster. The heat hit 45C in the summer and reaches -5C in the winter.\n\nHaving now built temperature controls, though, he said he is focusing on communicating the design aspect of the project. However, managing the smells from the toilet can also be an issue.\n\nHe said: \u2018We hope the dumpster will become a conversation box on subjects as wide as tiny housing, energy sustainability, science education, and higher quality of life. \n\n\u2018Ultimately, the hypothesis we are investigating is if a person can have a relatively good and happy life by downsizing.\n\n\u2018This is an outlier experiment. The students and university, thought they thought the experiment a bit odd, have warmed to the idea, even if they do stand upwind of me more than they used to.\u2019",

Despite indoor temps that ranged from 30 to 130, he seems to have lived quite comfortably most of the time with the help of an air-conditioner, a weather station, and a false floor for clothing storage. No bathroom or shower though. Wilson says the experience taught him how to lead a simpler life.\n\nWilson's next project will be to crash on 99 couches in Austin in 99 days.",

A professor living in an \"eco-friendly\" dumpster in Austin\n\nSEP 21, 2014, 2:00 PM\n\nBy Business Insider\n\nSave article\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE\n\nJeff Wilson lives in a dumpster. It\u2019s not what it sounds like: Wilson is an environmental science professor and dean at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, and he\u2019s working with his students and a team of experts to transform that dumpster into a sustainable home that costs under $10,000.\n\nHe uses the alter-ego \u201cProfessor Dumpster.\u201d\n\n\u201cProfessor Dumpster will be spending one year in a dumpster that is approximately 6 feet x 6 feet, or about 1% the size of the average new American home. Professor Dumpster, in his bid to become part of the \u2018new 1%\u2019 will strive to use 1% the water, 1% the energy, and create 1% the waste of the average American home,\u201d reads The Dumpster Project website.\n\nWe first came across Wilson over at The Atlantic, where they describe his downsizing from a 2,500-square-foot house to a 500-square-foot apartment and finally to the 36-square-foot dumpster. For reference, that\u2019s 152 square feet less than the self-proclaimed \u201cworld\u2019s smallest house\u201d in London, 204 square feet less than a typical $30,000 tiny house, and 92 square feet smaller than the tiny house in which a Business Insider reporter spent the weekend with her mom.\n\nWe were so intrigued by Wilson\u2019s project that we reached out to Team Dumpster to see if it had photos to share. We\u2019ve published them here with the group\u2019s permission.\n\nThe Dumpster Project will be completed in three phases, starting when Wilson took occupancy in February 2014: camping in a bare-bones dumpster (shown here); living in a dumpster \u201chome,\u201d with additions such as storage and a bed; and then fine-tuning the dumpster into the ultimate sustainable home.\n\nSign Up for the National Weekly Newsletter\nSIGN UP\n\nNow, the dumpster is starting to look a little more like home.\n\nHere, you can see its garden beds, mailbox, and sole window.\n\nThis photo was taken from the dumpster\u2019s sole window, which also functions as the door.\n\nIn the third and final stage, which hasn\u2019t yet begun, the team will continue adding to the home with a focus on making sure it uses 1% of the energy and water used in of the average American home.",

        "text": "Why Is This Professor Moving Into A Dumpster?\n\nMeet Jeff Wilson, an environmental scientist and the Dean of Huston Tillotson University in Austin,Texas. He has decided to live in a dumpster for the next year - Yes, the kind that you might find filled with trash behind a restaurant or in an alley.\n\nWilson says the inspiration to do something this radical first hit him two years ago, when he was working on an article at a neighborhood coffee shop and caught sight of an eight-yard dumpster. So when his apartment lease ran out a year later, the professor sold all of his possessions and spent the next seven months sleeping in his office, while he searched for a suitable trash can.\n\nNow that he has found one, Professor Dumpster is putting his students to work. After all, the point of this project isn't just to spend his life living out of a garbage can: there is, a much greater purpose involved. As an environmental scientist, the professor constantly ponders about sustainable living and how every person should try minimize his/her impact on our already stretched resources. That, is the challenge Wilson wanted his students to step up to, this entire year.\n\nUsing their math, science, engineering, and technology skills he wants them to retrofit his 33 square-foot dumpster into a modern space that includes a shower, toilet, kitchen and bed and is fitted with amenities like air-conditioning and even WiFi. The one caveat? It all has to be 'green' and sustainable.\n\nSome important things Wilson's students will have to consider are how to retrieve water, harness energy and keep a healthy living space. To live in this dumpster comfortably, the Professor will need filtered water for drinking, cooking, as well as, for other everyday activities like the toilet and shower. While this is not that big a deal, given that the dumpster has to be sustainable means that the used water has to be recycled as efficiently as possible.\n\nIn order to ensure that the professor remains healthy there also needs to be adequate ventilation, as well as, cooling and heating systems that function efficiently, without utilizing too much energy or space. While this may sound like an impossible task, the students are stepping up to the challenge and seem to be figuring it all out. By incorporating solar panels for lighting and electricity, nano-insulation to regulate temperature, and \"energy-producing\" features, they aim to create a sustainable living space.\n\nWilson's project is not just about living in a dumpster, but also about teaching his students valuable skills and lessons in sustainability and environmental responsibility. He hopes that by the end of this year-long experiment, he will have demonstrated the feasibility of sustainable living and inspired others to follow in his footsteps.\n\nResources: dumpsterproject.org,mnn.com,grist.org,fastcoexist.com,curbed.com",

It's in a metal dumpster that is typically meant for trash.\n\nJeff Wilson, an environmental science professor at Houston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, is known as 'Professor Dumpster' for teaching his students how to live while making a minimal impact on the environment.\n\n\"We want to teach issues around sustainability, STEM education, living on less, to a much broader audience than you might just reach in one small environmental science class,\" said Wilson.\n\nThe course is divided into three phases. The first phase is basic camping. Every day, either Wilson, one of his students or a member of the community spends a day in the dumpster. They use sleeping bags, filter the water from a nearby lake and wash with wet towels. For a toilet, they use bottles or the college restrooms. They also grow vegetables in a small garden.\n\nIn the second phase they will use energy-efficient appliances, while in the last phase their \u201chome\u201d will get solar panels and a composting toilet.\n\nSome students were skeptical at first, but others liked the idea from the start. One student said, \"He explained about the dumpster project and I told him, 'that's so weird that it's awesome.\u2019 So I got right on board,\u201d said student Angelica Erazo.\n\nWilson said three square meters is slightly more than one percent of the average new American home. He wants to see if it\u2019s possible to live with only one percent of average energy and water consumption, while creating only one percent of the average home\u2019s waste.",

        "text": "Professor Dumpster Launches Affordable Micro Apartments for Urban Dwellers\n\nLast Updated: April 7, 2021\nFirst Published: October 11, 2015\n\nBy Assia Schou\n\nThe best ideas often spring from unanticipated sources and the tiny smart home Kasita is no exception. When Jeff Wilson aka Professor Dumpster spent a year living in a used dumpster, a social experiment that reduced the definition of \u201chome\u201d to a 33 square foot extreme, a concept emerged.\n\nAs the experiment drew to a close, Wilson took what he\u2019d learned and returned to the drawing board where Kasita came to life, a new category of home that married iconic design and pioneering technology with insights gleaned from a trashcan.\n\nThe Kasita is 208 square feet with 10-foot ceilings and is designed to not only feel spacious and full of light, but to be fully equipped with all the amenities you would find in a traditional home or apartment\u2014and then some. In addition to a walk-in shower, refrigerator, and convection oven the design team have also thrown in a dishwasher, washer/dryer combo, cooktop, and a queen size bed that easily tucks away out of sight (without having to even make it).\n\nYour Kasita will welcome you home by adjusting the A/C, bringing up the lights and shades, and queueing your favorite playlist. Or, ask your Kasita to do something else (like rolling out the bed) via hands-free voice commands throughout.\n\nKasita\u2019s unique tile system allows for virtually infinite customizations and options for the home while maintaining order and function.\n\nThe best part is that the apartments are expected to rent at half of the market rate for a studio. The company expects to have Kasitas on the ground in Austin in 2016 and they are exploring rollout in ten additional cities (including one international city) starting in 2017.\n\nSpend your money on life \u2014 not rent. Through partnerships with local entities, Kasita will rent units at about half the market rate of a studio apartment. In Downtown Austin, that\u2019s about $600 a month.\n\nKasita is the smallest home built for the city. Its tiny size presents almost limitless opportunities for location.",

        "text": "Could you live in a dumpster for a year?\n\n26th May 2015\nSHARE\nJeff Wilson lives in a dumpster. When you hear this, your mind might automatically visualise a homeless man, or so I assume. But this is not the case, Jeff chose to live in a dumpster to escape his conventional, consumerist and comfortable lifestyle.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, before his dumpster days, he was living in a comfortable, 3,000 square-foot home in Texas, with a walk-in closet, a grand and accessible bathroom and a $1,600 monthly mortgage payment. He worked as a professor at a state university, he commuted one hour to work everyday and had \"a matrimonial social arrangement with a fellow professional.\"\n\nAnd now, he has none of those things and has never been happier! So what changed?\n\nHe received a new job as an associate professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, and lived in a dumpster on the college campus for a year until he vacated last month.\n\n\u201cAS A WAY OF HAVING A BETTER LIFE, I DECIDED TO MOVE INTO A DUMPSTER.\u201d\n- Jeff Wilson told The Post\n\nHe decks out the dumpster pretty well, complete with air-conditioning, a mailbox and false-floor storage space. The challenge was done to prove that people don't need a big home packed with endless possessions to be happy, and they exist!\n\nThe immediate benefits were obvious to Wilson, they included lower rent, lower utility payments, less time spent doing chores, shorter commute (90 seconds on foot) and less money spent on unnecessary possessions.\n\nBecause of his much smaller living space, Wilson told The Post that he spent a lot less time at home. Instead, he hung around on campus ACTUALLY speaking to people and interacting with other human beings.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, \"There are all these studies that say the broader and deeper your social network is, not only does it create more happiness, but it increases your life span,\" Wilson said. \"In the modern home you can have a cradle to grave experience. Your doula can pop you out in the living room, you can get an MIT education online, order food from outside and then work from home until you die in the living room watching your flat screen TV.\"\n\nWilson had to give up almost all of his possessions. Among the few possessions he purchased while living in the dumpster were a garden gnome and a small air conditioning unit, as the dumpster reached scorching hot levels inside.\n\nFrom his dumpster experiment Wilson also learnt the detriment of noise, and how it keeps us from looking for a meaningful life.\n\n\"You can't be aware enough to watch for meaning if you're buried in e-mails or facing a barrage of direct messages on Twitter,\" he told The Post. \"You don't have the bandwidth or the time or the attention to watch. You're looking, but watching is a different exercise.\"\n\nThe dumpster project allows all of us to really think about the stuff we own and what we rely on, or what we THINK we need. If we take a leaf from Professor Dumpster's book then we can see just how little we need to be happy, and that human interaction and experiences are what create purpose... not things.\n\nImages credited to Sarah Natsumi More and Jeff Wilson",

As people continue to scale down, living more simplistic, minimalist lives, many report feeling happier. To determine just how little a person could live happily and comfortable on, Wilson is conducting an experiment to see how small he can go; and he\u2019s doing it in a repurposed dumpster.\n\nFor one year Wilson will live in a 33 square ft dumpster, transforming the \u201chome\u201d from its bare bones to a high-tech., sustainable living quarter along the way, all while monitoring the minimum needed to survive and thrive. For the first few months of The Dumpster Project, Wilson was sleeping inside the dumpster on cardboard boxes. He has since upgraded to a bed, minimal storage and even air conditioning. He still fetches water but will soon be connecting a shower and toilet to the dumpster through the outside.\n\nWilson poses these thought-provoking questions to his class: What does home look like in a world of 10 billion people? How do we equip current and future generations with the tools they need for sustainable living practices? Can the world\u2019s finite resources actually sustain the swelling population?\n\nWilson will enter the project\u2019s third phase in a few months, the phase he calls the \u201cuber dumpster home.\u201d That\u2019s where the dumpster will be retrofitted with solar panels, go completely off the electric grid and obtain that coveted curb appeal\u2013 by making it look less like a dumpster.\n\nProfessor Wilson told The Atlantic, \u201cThe big hypothesis we\u2019re trying to test here is, can you have a pretty darn good life on much, much less?\u201d He paused. \u201cThis is obviously an outlier experiment. But so far, I have, I\u2019d say. A better life than I had before.\u201d\n\nOn October 6-8 The Dumpster Project will be on display at SXSWECO.\n\nPhotos: Sarah Natsumi",

The pre-fabricated homes can be constructed in three weeks \u2014 and could go a long way toward easing the affordable housing crunch that has bedeviled much of the country.\n\nWith the help of former employees at Google, Elon Musk's SolarCity and Bell Helicopter, Wilson thinks he has a solution to provide homes and stackable apartments in unused pieces of land such as vacant parking lots. \"If you file for a backyard unit, it can be approved in weeks,\" says Wilson, who predicts his homes could hit the market this summer.\n\n\"We need to find cracks in the system rather than take a sledgehammer to it,\" he says.\n\nIf the reaction of consumers at Kasita's recent party at SXSW is any indication, interest is high. Hundreds patiently waited in line to get a peek at the modular home, which features a bathroom/shower, kitchen, bedroom and living room patio.\n\nA remote control allows dwellers to quickly change mood lighting and an entertainment system. Date mode finds Marvin Gaye's smooth voice filling the small living area. Storage space is built into steps, walls and other nooks and crannies.\n\nThe 21-person start-up, based here, is not only espousing the mantra that small is beautiful, but it can be environmental and profitable. Wilson says several mayors are interested in the homes, and he intends to visit California to make his pitch this month.\n\n\"Green is the new black,\" Wilson says.",

But this year's Democratic National Convention has seen some seriously scathing attacks on Donald Trump \u2013 and they're not just coming from Joe Biden or Kamala Harris.\n\nOn the first night of the convention, former President Bill Clinton delivered a barnburner of a speech that basically called Trump out for being, well, an old-fashioned sexist. Clinton even threw in a joke about how his wife Hillary is more popular than Trump \u2013 and we mean \"popular\" as in, she's got a better approval rating.\n\nBut the real zinger came from Barack Obama, who appeared via video to make fun of Trump's... shall we say, unique pronunciation of his own name. You know, the one where he says it like this: \"Trii-ump.\"\n\nObama's dig was met with thunderous applause \u2013 and it set the tone for a night that saw some truly brutal takedowns of Trump.\n\nThe Democratic convention has seen its fair share of witty one-liners and scathing attacks on the 45th president. But what's interesting is how these lines are being used to galvanize Democrats around a clear message: that this is an election about more than just policy \u2013 it's about character, and who you want to be your leader.\n\nSo, will \"going low\" work for the Democrats? It's too early to tell \u2013 but one thing's for sure: they're giving it their all.",

Wilson\u2019s not \u201call talk\u201d, either, and will spend the next year of his life living in a standard 6\u2019x6\u2032 commercial dumpster to prove his point.\n\nThis dumpster, to be specific \u2026 which, yeah. That\u2019s a dumpster.\nCalling him \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d, the Dumpster Project website is chronicling Wilson\u2019s year in the dumps- which began back in February- and using his experience as a basis for a video documentary that will, presumably, debut at SXSW next year.\n\nWilson \u201cwill be spending one year in a dumpster that is approximately 6 feet x 6 feet, or about 1% the size of the average new American home. Professor Dumpster, in his bid to become part of the \u2018new 1%\u2019 will strive to use 1% the water, 1% the energy, and create 1% the waste of the average American home.\u201d\n\nFor the moment, the dumpster is just that- a 6\u00d76 foot dumpster that\u2019s been cleaned out, painted, and hooked up to the grid. Wilson, however, has bigger plans for his 1% home. If \u201cphase 1\u201d is the dumpster, itself, \u201cphase 2\u201d adds a shade structure to minimize his need for the \u201cwindow\u201d mounted AC unit, as well as a laundry unit/bathroom built into a tool shed next to the unit \u2026\n\nWilson\u2019s forward-looking plans would stack dumpsters, Lego-style, and use their opened \u201clids\u201d as perfectly placed solar \u201cleaves\u201d, each of which would hold a solar PV panel of its own that would allow Professor Dumpster to separate fully from the grid, and even teach his classes outside.\n\nYou can check out Wilson\u2019s \u201cpitch\u201d for the project in a short video below.",

        "text": "How to get students thinking about their environmental footprints?\n\nJeff Wilson and his students at Huston-Tillotson University in Austin retrofitted a garbage container into a cozy pad where he lived for a year. It was, he says, \"a radical experiment in what it would mean to live on, and in, less\" - specifically, 33 square feet. He moved out in February, but the experiment continues.\n\nNine educators since have taken up residency for up to a week to see what it's like to live without running water. Cooking is on a camping stove. But there is electricity. To battle interior heat that rises to over 130 degrees in Texas' sweltering summers, the bin had to be connecting to the grid so air conditioning could be installed. There's now a TV and an overhead light. But it's still tight quarters.\n\n\"There were a few who grabbed the spirit early on, like they were camping,\" says Amanda M. Masino, a biology professor and co-director of the Dumpster Project. \"And then there were some that brought two pieces of luggage and realized they didn't have room to open it in here.\"\n\nTeachers are welcome for sleepovers. And Masino has developed a curriculum in which students design workable tech for the space - such as using sheep wool, more environmentally friendly than fiberglass, as insulation. Elementary students might build water filters; college students design solar-powered installations. More than 1,400 have visited the container, which also travels to science and art exhibits across the state to share its sustainability message.\n\nAs for Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, he had his dislikes (school gym as bathroom) and likes (mobility, scaled-down possessions). He has left Huston-Tillotson to funnel the lessons learned into an urban living experiment: prefab apartments of only 225 square feet (seven times the size of his previous residence) that fit onto a rack and can be transported. Each rack holds four units. Austin gets the first rack in April (rent: about $600 a month before slotting fees), with other cities to follow.\n\n\"Even at the extreme end of the spectrum,\" Wilson concludes, \"a lot less can bring a lot more to your life.\"",

Each home is 352 square feet, stackable and costs $139,000. They\u2019re well suited for people who love to travel and like to spend time outside and out and about instead of cooped up in their homes.\n\nOriginally, Kasita was exploring the ability to allow each little home to move from city to city by hauling them on a truck and plugging them into a unit of Kasitas. Potential customers were more interested in elevating the technology within the homes and then simply moving their small amount of belongings from home to home if they so choose, Curbed explains.\n\nThere\u2019s so much to see and learn about these incredible little Kasitas.

As an example, cattle consume 17 times more calories in grain than they produce as meat.\n\n\u201cWith so many delicious and Earth-friendly meat-, dairy-, and egg-free foods available, no one has to live in a dumpster to help save the planet,\u201d says PETA Special Projects Manager Alicia Woempner. \u201cAnd because meat-eaters are more prone to life-threatening conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, Dr. Wilson can help ensure his own sustainability simply by going vegan.\u201d\n\nFor more information, please visit PETA.org.\n\nPETA\u2019s letter to Dr. Jeff Wilson follows:\n\nDear Dr. Wilson,\n\nI\u2019m writing on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and our more than 3 million members and supporters, including thousands across Texas. As an organization that works hard to raise awareness of the devastating impact of the animal-agriculture industry on our environment, we applaud your efforts to promote sustainable living. I\u2019d also like to urge you to go vegan and encourage your students to do the same, since cutting out resource-intensive meat, egg, and dairy foods is the best thing that we can all do to protect the planet and animals.\n\nRaising and killing animals for food is simply unsustainable. The United Nations has stated that a global shift to a vegan diet is vital in order to combat the worst effects of climate change, and the Stockholm International Water Institute warns that transitioning to a plant-based diet is the only way to feed the world\u2019s growing population. Eating meat wastes valuable resources. It takes up to 13 pounds of grain and 2,500 gallons of water to produce just a pound of meat. And it takes 18 times more land to produce 1 pound of chicken than it does to produce 1 pound of high-protein, cholesterol-free vegan \u201cchicken.\u201d\n\nIn addition to trashing the planet, the meat, dairy, and egg industries cause untold amounts of animal suffering. Chickens, for example, are crammed into filthy, ammonia-filled sheds for the majority of their short lives before they are packed into trucks for transport through all weather extremes to slaughter, during which they have their throats cut while they\u2019re still conscious and are often boiled alive.\n\nWith so many delicious and Earth-friendly meat-, dairy-, and egg-free foods available, no one has to live in a dumpster to help save the planet. And because meat-eaters are more prone to life-threatening conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, Dr. Wilson can help ensure his own sustainability simply by going vegan.\n\nFor more information about veganism, please visit PETA.org.\n\nSincerely,\nAlicia Woempner",

(Seriously, were there no dumpsters behind the business school? Or the environmental studies program?)\n\nWell, Dumpster Dad is back, and he\u2019s now been promoted to Professor Dumpster. The Atlantic has a lengthy feature on Professor Dumpster (aka Jeff Wilson), one of those sweet glossy features with animated GIFs and dumpster schematics, and here are a few of the updates on Professor Dumpster\u2019s life:\n\n\u2014 People actually call Wilson \u201cProfessor Dumpster.\u201d I have no idea if this generated naturally or if it is Wilson\u2019s self-styled nickname (and BRAND). I do know that it is the name on Wilson\u2019s Instagram.\n\n\u2014 When we last heard from Wilson, he was ABD \u2014 All But Dumpster. Yes, when he first announced himself on the dumpster-living scene he wasn\u2019t actually living full-time in the dumpster! He was just camping there sometimes. Now he\u2019s apparently in the dumpster nearly every night, except for the nights he trades off with students from Green Is the New Black, an ecology group.\n\n\u2014 The dumpster is \u201csanctioned and supported\u201d by Huston-Tillotson University, the East Austin university at which Professor Dumpster both teaches and serves as Dean of the University College.\n\n\u2014 Professor Dumpster owns four pairs of pants, four shirts, and \u201ceight or nine\u201d bow ties.\n\n\u2014 The dumpster has air conditioning.\n\n\u2014 There is no mention of the woman that took up the last third of Wilson\u2019s XOJane piece, who \u2014 as a recap \u2014 met Wilson when he invited her on a blind date to explore Europe for 21 days and told her she couldn\u2019t pack anything.\n\n\u2014 There\u2019s no mention of Wilson\u2019s daughter, either. Has her mother relented and allowed her to spend overnights in the dumpster with daddy?\n\n\u2014 The dumpster is still \u201ctucked behind the women\u2019s residence halls.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think? Is the tiny house movement laudable, or is there something about this dumpster project that stinks? Take a minute to read the Atlantic profile, and then we can come back and discuss Professor Dumpster together.",

        "text": "'Prof. Dumpster' Will Teach Your Kids to Live in a Garbage Bin\nBy Amy Schellenbaum Oct 7, 2013, 4:30pm EDT\n\nLook out hipster Dumpster dwellers, there's a new microhome connoisseur in town and Professor Dumpster has got the credentials to blot your meager garbage can home out of the adaptive reuse scene. Featured recently over at Co.Exist, Prof. Dumpster (real name: Jeff Wilson), an environmental scientist over at Huston Tillotson University in Austin, Texas, plans to live in a souped up garbage can for a year, outfitting the 33-square-foot space with essentials like a shower, toilet, kitchen, and Wi-Fi.\n\nOver the course of the year, the professor\u2014a youngish guy with a goofy smile and thick-framed glasses\u2014aims to \"engage the next generation in creative thinking about the important topics of sustainability and science education,\" citing the likes of Bill Nye the Science Guy and Ms. Frizzle as influences.\n\nPer Co.Exist, Wilson came up with the idea while working on a paper in Starbucks: \"I looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight-yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that I was definitely moving into a dumpster.\" A year later he sold his belongings\u2014each item was $1\u2014and began living (clandestinely) in his office at the university. After seven months of that he bought and cleaned a used bin that, at 33-square-feet, measures just 1 percent the size of 2011's average new-built American home.\n\nFor the first phrase of the project, Wilson will be what he calls \"Dumpster camping,\" living in an empty shell, curled in a sleeping bag on the floor. Then he and his students will outfit the whole shebang in the types of modern conveniences that sap resources in regular homes: air conditioning, regular-bulb lighting, Xbox, and the like. It's all to establish a baseline for the final phase: an environmental impact makeover that brings in things like \"energy-producing\" toilets and nano-insulation to maintain temperature. (Yeah, OK, \"pimped out\" was the phrase Wilson used.) The plan is to travel around performing for kids in grades K through 12, even going into \"stealth mode\" and \"dropping it on a kids' playground and seeing what happens ... Because they're going to open the door and see an Xbox, a bed, a shower, all these things.\" More info, right this way.",

        "text": "A Year In A Dumpster: Texas Professor Completes Experiment And Moves Out [Video]\n\nBy Cy Holl\nPublished on: 07:09 PST, Feb 6, 2015\n\nDr. Jeff Wilson, a dean and assistant professor of biological sciences at Huston-Tillotson University, wanted to research sustainable living. So, as eccentric professors tend to do, he moved into a 33-square-foot dumpster. Dr. Wilson affectionately became known as \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d after spending a year in the tiny dwelling.\n\nOver the course of 365 days, Wilson, or one of his students, spent every night in the makeshift home. The inhabitants of the dumpster had to make do with a small space, but they spruced up the place a bit. Solar panels and electrical connections were made in order for the trash container to have light and air conditioning. Other features include storage under a false floor and a weather station on the sliding roof door (it takes measurements every five minutes).\n\nThe dumpster sits on the campus of Houston-Tillotson University and will remain there, despite the end of the experiment.\n\nAlbuquerque Journal reports that Dr. Wilson will miss his time in the dumpster.\n\n\u201cThe last few nights have been really sweet\u2026 Identitywise, am I still Professor Dumpster if I\u2019m not living in a dumpster? I don\u2019t know if this is what my mom wanted for her first-born son.\u201d\n\nThe Dumpster Project was born out of a want to research sustainability. Wilson began with the hypothesis that \u201cone can have a pretty good life in and on a lot less.\u201d Essentially, the concept melted down into this: \u201cStuff is noise.\u201d Wilson and his students wanted to know if it was possible to live in a dumpster for a year, and what sort of challenges they would face in doing so.\n\nAccording to NBCDFW, a local NBC News affiliate, Wilson \u201cevicted\u201d himself on Wednesday during a reception on campus. The dumpster will be remaining on campus as a future teaching aid, and \u201cThe Dumpster Project \u2018Home\u2019 School\u201d will have curriculum on sustainability.\n\nEducators will be staying in the dumpster, according to Amanda Masino, who also teaches biology at Huston-Tillotson, and students will be given a \u201csemiridiculous challenge: Turn the dumpster into a house. What happens when you don\u2019t have constant temperature? Where do you get water? How do you treat it?\u201d\n\nWilson believes that having the dumpster on campus will help students understand sustainability better than \u201ctalking about it in a dry way.\u201d\n\nDr. Wilson did not spend the entire year in the dumpster himself. He estimates that he spent about 250 nights in the dwelling. Other nights he was travelling with his daughter or spending the night with his girlfriend. They couldn\u2019t exactly go to his place, now could they?\n\nDon\u2019t let the silliness of the experiment fool you; there was a more serious note to the experiment.\n\n\u201cIt pushes your limits. It totally blew up the idea of what a home is. In this climate, having central air and heat is more necessary than having a kitchen. But it would have been nice to have a toilet. The main complaint from students was a weak Wi-Fi signal \u2014 allegedly to do their homework.\u201d\n\nWilson will continue to be part of Project Dumpster, however, he has a new experiment to complete: spending 99 nights in a variety of homes all over Austin.\n\nWould you, or could you, spend a year in a space as small as a dumpster?",

        "text": "Jeff Wilson invented Kasita micro-homes after living in dumpster\nBy Monika ThakurApril 4, 2017Updated:August 18, 20222 Mins Read\nJeff Wilson, former dean of Huston-Tillotson University in Texas, spent two years of his life living in a dumpster. This experience made him embrace the minimalist lifestyle and inspired him to invent a micro-housing startup, called Kasita, in 2015. Measuring 31 x 12-feet, these tiny homes can be fitted or stacked over one another to serve as a function- home, workspace, and pop-up commercial space.\n\nThese prefabricated homes can be assembled off-site and delivered in two to three weeks. The stackable units can easily be installed almost anywhere on any terrain. Each unit has been designed to offer a sustainable, space-efficient and cost-efficient micro-living for changing city lifestyles.\n\nInside the modular units, you can find all essentials of a home, including bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen, and storage space. On raising the entry section, you\u2019ll find this underfloor storage that further leads to a sunken living/bedroom area, making the area appear more spacious.\n\nIt also contains a glass-clad cube-shaped section that offers undivided views of the surrounding landscape and also brings in natural daylight. The unique concept of the house also suggests a new form of real estate, allowing the homeowners to relocate their living space to any desired place. The energy is provided by directly plugging these units into any grid.\n\nBesides that, these micro-housing units can also be powered via renewable energies for off-grid, sustainable living. Some of these tiny homes will be ready for delivery in June 2017. Find out more information on the official website.",

Harvard-educated Dr. Jeff Wilson started this project in February and is now famous among his students by the name of \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d. The purpose of this project is to show people that one can lead a pretty good life even in such conditions.\n\nCurrently, the dark green dumpster is parked in a corner of Huston-Tillotson University\u2019s campus behind the women\u2019s residence halls. According to Wilson, it is \u201cthe most thoughtfully designed tiniest home ever constructed\u201d. Before their professor moved in, the students of Wilson cleaned and fixed the place for him to make it fit for residing in.\n\nThey are planning to set up solar panels and an energy-producing toilet to make the dwelling as energy efficient as possible. Wilson started downsizing his place of living after his divorce, firstly moving from a 2500 sq ft house to a 500 square foot apartment and selling off all his spare clothes and furniture at $1 per item.\n\nIt was soon after that he realized how little he needed to survive. Eventually, this played a vital role in implementing this dumpster living idea. Wilson, who had lived in his office for seven months after the lease on his apartment ran out, admitted, \u2018Keeping that secret for seven months especially from the 3am cleaning staff and the 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself.\u2019\n\nBut soon he pitched in the dumpster idea and got the university to sanction it and support it. The project revolves around the concept that the person will live on 1% of everything a random American uses, that is 1% space, 1% water, 1% energy and also producing only 1% of waste.\n\n\u2018We could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d Wilson elaborated while explaining the perks of the dumpster home. \u201cFueled by sunlight and surface water, people could have a pretty good laugh.\u201d Being a minimalist now, Wilson only owns four pairs of pants, four shirts, three pair of shoes and a few bow ties.\n\nHe stores all his worldly possessions under a false floor that was recently installed. His camping cooking equipment is also stored there. Wilson got used to the place in a few months, and after installing some useful amenities, he started feeling comfortable at his new place.\n\nOne of the first things was replacing the tarp roof with a sliding pitched roof with a weather station on top. Six months later, he fitted a modest air conditioner to cope with the extreme Austin heat. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make it too easy,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to see how elastic my sleeping habits would be relative to temperature and humidity.\n\nI found that I could actually get to sleep in 2 minutes.\u201d The project is not just about surviving but also about living a better life, Wilson said. He has an arrangement in place in case he needs an occasional break from the project. His students occupy his place willingly for the night.\n\nHe is planning tours across the US to educate students about the concept of \u2018less is more\u2019, after this project year is over.",

        "text": "The Teacher Who Lived In a Dumpster Turned Tiny House - You Won't Believe How Great it Looks Inside!\n\nLast updated: 2016/01/24\n\nEnvironmental Science Professor Jeff Wilson at the Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas lived in a dumpster for an entire year. Yes, you read that right, he lived in a dumpster, although not in the way you would first assume. Jeff chose a dumpster as his new home as part of an experiment to test the limits of home. He and a couple of other professors along with students began with a 33 square foot dumpster, a clean one of course, and made it into a surprisingly livable space.\n\nShop Tiny Homes\n\nJeff gave away most of his possessions and moved into the tiny space he would call home for the year. The project was a way to highlight the housing issue in the United States and all over the world, a problem that is quite complex and actually fairly old. Jeff explained that real estate as an institution is centuries old, but many wealthy families store their money in real estate making it difficult for those looking to rent or buy homes and land.\n\nJeff's goal has been to \"find the cracks in the system\" as he puts it, to make things a bit easier for the average person. If you look at home buying trends, you'll find that many younger people, particularly millennials, are not buying homes. They are already tied down with student loan debts which makes it almost impossible to save money and housing prices are way too far out of reach.\n\nSo it makes sense to find a new way to create affordable housing for people so that homeownership isn't such a far off dream which is where the tiny house movement comes into play. But first, Jeff had to undergo his experiment in his very tiny space to wrap his head around downsizing in an extreme way. In 2014, he got his dumpster and put it on the university campus filling it with only the items he used regularly and that he loved.\n\nAfter a while he got the nickname \"Professor Dumpster,\" and he stayed in the dumpster turned tiny house pretty much every night for the entire year. He made the space feel larger by painting the walls white and adding in creative storage solutions which made the tiny house space more livable. Although, there were still things he absolutely couldn't fit into the tiny dumpster home.\n\nOf course, there was no practical way to add a bathroom or a kitchen in such a small space. So he instead used the dorm cafeteria as his kitchen and the gym at the university as his shower room. He had to be very careful not to use up all of the resources from the dorms or he would get kicked out.\n\nThe experiment was to see how long it would take Jeff to realize that living in a dumpster was not sustainable, even if it was possible. It took him about 6 months to figure this out and then he started looking for new housing options. But during his time in the dumpster, Jeff learned a lot about sustainability and about the importance of community.\n\nHe found that by living in such close quarters with others that they developed a sense of community and they all helped each other out. They would have dinner together, watch movies together, and even go to class together. It was like one big happy family.\n\nJeff's experiment showed that it is possible to live in small spaces, but it may not be the most sustainable way to live. He learned that living in a community with others can make life more enjoyable and that by working together you can achieve great things.\n\nThe experience also made Jeff realize how lucky he was to have had this opportunity. Not everyone has access to such resources as the dorms at the university, and not everyone is able to afford housing in their city.\n\nJeff's experiment may have been small, but it had a big impact on his life. He learned that living simply does not mean giving up all of your comforts. It means finding ways to live with less so that you can enjoy more.",

        "text": "Jeff Wilson provides housing solution with modular Kasita living units\n\nFormer professor/current micro housing CEO Jeff Wilson and his team at Kasita have developed a modular, versatile, and transportable living unit self-titled \"Kasita.\" The idea for the project came about after he spent an entire year living in a 33 ft2 dumpster to experiment with the possibilities and challenges of living in an extremely constricted space and come up with solutions to increase its functionality without compromising comfort.\n\nThe modular pods measuring roughly 31\u2032 x 12\u2032 can be fitted to serve almost any function-home, workspace, pop-up commercial space-and can be installed almost anywhere and on any terrain. The project provides a sustainable, cost and space efficient solution for a growing population and changing lifestyles.\n\nEach unit contains the essentials for a home, a bedroom, bathroom, living room and kitchen, and storage space, as well as the \u2018cube\u2019 which is a glass-clad projection that provides views and natural light into the home. Every part of the house serves at least one function, maximizing the efficiency of the space and allowing the inhabitant to determine their own aesthetic for living.\n\nThe concept also suggests a new form of real estate, with the module small enough to fit on the back of a truck, when the owner wants to move they can take their exact same home with them and install it into a new location. A Kasita can exist individually or clustered with others to make vertical structures as a modular apartment complex, adding to the usability in almost any urban context.\n\nThe entrance located at one end of the rectangular footprint opens into a more concealed area naturally lit by slender clerestory windows. This space contains primarily the bathroom and kitchen area. Raising the entry section provides for underfloor storage and leads to a sunken living/bedroom area that enjoys a taller space and more open feel.\n\nThe cube is in turn raised off the ground once more providing further storage and a secondary space for various other activities. Energy is provided by directly plugging into any grid but could also be powered through renewable energies, with engineered energy loads to properly run the space.\n\nWhen folded up, the bedroom serves as living space. The cube window at one end of the house provides plenty of natural light and ventilation as well as views. A compact but contemporary kitchen provides all cooking needs.\n\nThe modular pods can be stacked and used in urban environments.",

        "text": "A Harvard researcher invented these $139,000 stackable homes that can be built in under three weeks\n\nLeanna Garfield Updated Mar 15, 2018, 10:47 PM GMT+8\n\nJeff Wilson spent one of his two years as dean of Huston-Tillotson University in Texas living in a dumpster. Advertisement\n\nThe experience made him embrace minimalist living, and inspired him to launch a tiny home startup, called Kasita, in 2015.\n\n\"While the experiment was extreme, the experience I gained by living small and simple made a big impression,\" said Wilson, who is a former postdoctoral researcher at Harvard and IBM project manager. \"At the end of the year, I left the dumpster with the concept for a new category of housing \u2014 a beautiful, small footprint home designed as a solution for the growing housing crisis.\"\n\nBased in Austin, Texas, Kasita offers housing units that can sit by themselves or stack to form apartments. The pre-fabricated homes can be assembled off-site and delivered in two to three weeks, Wilson says.\n\nIn 2017, the startup started selling its first tiny homes, which measure 352 square feet and cost $139,000. A newer iteration of the home \u2014 which features additional storage \u2014 was shown at this year's SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. The latest Kasita homes are now on sale for the same price.\n\nKasita sells tiny housing units. The startup gets its name from \"casita,\" the Spanish word for \"little house.\"\n\nThe main, open-layout space functions as both a living room and bedroom. In the model unit, a bed pulls out from the sofa (the units come unfurnished).\n\nAcross from the living room, there's a sleek kitchen. There's an electric stovetop, full oven, and dishwasher, too.\n\nAround the corner, there's a bathroom with a shower.\n\nDrawers are located inside stairs.\n\nEach home also features tech integrations, including glass windows that adjust their transparency depending on the amount of natural sunlight.\n\nThe unit also comes with an Amazon Echo Dot, which lets users control the home's systems with their voice.\n\nKasita units can stack on top of each other to form a complex ... or they can sit on rooftops ... or in backyards.\n\n\"We want to take the noise out of buying a home. Imagine how great it would be to be able to buy a home as easily as you buy a product,\" Wilson said. \"The long-term plan would be that you could just put in your address and credit card number and we would care of the rest.\"\n\nWilson got the idea for Kasita after living in a dumpster for a year in 2014. Owning a lot of stuff felt burdensome, so he sold the majority of his possessions and moved into (and renovated) the small, empty dumpster in Austin, Texas.\n\nFuture Kasita designs will evolve based on owners' needs and wants.\n\n\"The way we build housing (and even skyscrapers) hasn\u2019t changed substantially in over 100 years, and a lot of that lag is because we haven\u2019t updated the way we approach building,\" he said.",

        "text": "Here is the extracted main article text:\n\nSAN FRANCISCO\nInside the modular home inspired by dumpster living\n\u201cWhat we have here is a solution,\u201d says founder\n\nBy Adam Brinklow Apr 9, 2018, 2:48pm PDT\n\nPhotos by Patricia Chang\n\nAustin-based startup Kasita\u2019s micro, 352-square-foot prefabricatited modular apartments are, in all likelihood, the best thing to ever come out of a Texas dumpster.\n\nOnce upon a time, Kasita founder Jeff Wilson was dean at Austin\u2019s Huston-Tillotson University, where he made headlines in 2014 for his sustainable living experiment living inside a 33-square-foot modified dumpster for one year.\n\n\u201cIt was an experiment in being part of the one percent\u2014as in, one percent the size of the average American home,\u201d Wilson tells Curbed SF.\n\nAlthough this sounds like a stunt, the experiment did yield tangible results, sending Wilson away with the nickname \u201cProfessor Dumpster\u201d and with ambitions to design and market the ultimate sustainable tiny apartment.\n\n\u201cWe could end up with a house under $10,000 that could be placed anywhere in the world,\u201d he speculated in comments to The Atlantic in 2014.\n\nThe modular home that Wilson parked in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay last Friday, in a bid to attract the curious eyes of potential San Francisco buyers and builders, is not so modest: Kasita\u2019s pre-made apartments start at $89,000 for a studio unit that variously measures between 352 and 370 square feet, depending on the method used.\n\nSo, why would Wilson leave the relative comfort and security of academia in favor of what he calls \u201cthe least secure position in the world\u201d as head of a startup?\n\n\u201cLargely because the whole situation was fucked,\u201d he tells Curbed SF.\n\nBy \u201cthe whole situation\u201d he means the housing crisis.\n\n\u201cSomething had to be done about it,\u201d Wilson continues. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a real problem here, not just making an app for something that your mom used to do for you like a lot of these companies.\u201d\n\nKasita began selling homes in 2017. Benji Miller, director of operations, estimates that they produce roughly one unit per week right now. He also says approximately half of the company\u2019s backlog orders are California-based.\n\nThe Kasita concept is that a single unit can be plopped down to serve as a single home all on its own\u2014probably as a backyard in-law or cottage, zoning permitted\u2014or that developers may stack the modular homes into multi-family building designs.\n\nMiller says the company considers four- to five-story buildings ideal, noting that at around 75 square feet it starts to become more challenging and expensive to keep the structure sound. He estimates construction time at about half that of standard means.\n\nAs for the tiny apartment interiors, a Kasita home is essentially a portable showcase of modern apartment aesthetics, with a sleek kitchen, a bedroom with a large window, and a compact bathroom.\n\n\u201cPeople are used to living in small spaces,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be some utopian movement, we\u2019re just making it possible for people to live in the city at an affordable price.\u201d\n\nThe modular home on display is a prototype, but it\u2019s designed to show off what Kasita can do. It features a spacious interior with plenty of natural light and smart home technology that makes it feel like a luxury apartment.\n\nKasita plans to sell the homes for around $89,000 each, which might seem expensive, but it includes all the necessary permits and inspections to make it easy for buyers to just move right in.\n\nThe company is currently working on refining its design and pricing strategy, but it hopes to have the homes available for sale within the next year.\n\nAs for Wilson, he\u2019s thrilled with how far the project has come. \u201cWe\u2019re not some bunch of hippies trying to save the world,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re just a group of people who want to make housing more affordable.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to revolutionize the way people live in cities by making homes that are smaller, greener, and cheaper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about us,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cIt\u2019s about creating a movement where we can build something better together.\u201d",

        "text": "Meet Jeff Wilson: a former IBM project manager and dean at Huston-Tillotson University, who also happened to live in a dumpster for a year.\n\nWhat started as a project on minimalist living and sustainability developed into KASITA, Wilson's company that is making high-tech, moveable homes.\n\nWilson started off working for IBM during the dot-com boom, but quickly became frustrated with the corporate grind. After burying his Rolex in the desert, Wilson eventually found himself as a dean of a university with the novel concept of living in a dumpster.\n\n\"The idea was to test the absolute limits of what one needs to have a pretty good life,\" Wilson told Tech Insider. \"And although it wasn\u2019t originally aimed at housing, the idea around housing evolved from it.\"\n\nSo Wilson sold the majority of his possessions for a dollar a pop, getting the word out by posting a Facebook message his students could see. He showered at the University and fit the rest of his personal belongings in a backpack.\n\n\"One night, lying on my back in the dumpster staring up at the stars as we all do, I had that 'aha' dumpster epiphany, if you will,\" he said. \"There was something here to solve for one of our country\u2019s biggest problems.\"\n\nSo Wilson set off to design KASITA \u2014 a 208-square-foot home that can easily be set up and moved anywhere.\n\nIt has a bathroom, a kitchenette, study, and a lounge. There's also a tucked away queen-sized bed that comes with a Casper mattress.\n\nBut the KASITA homes also come with high-tech perks, like a Nest thermostat, Amazon Echo, and special glass developed by SageGlass that changes shade based on how bright it is outside so you don't need blinds.\n\nThe homes also comes with Philip Hue Lighting that lets you control the color and intensity of your lights using an app. All of the technology included in the home will be integrated into a central, KASITA app so it's easy to control your home's settings, Wilson said. A lot of the features can also be operated using voice command, he added.\n\n\"What I wanted to do was design, essentially, an iPhone that you could live in,\" Wilson said. \"Something that\u2019s beautifully designed, mass manufacturable, [and] affordable to a much wider group of people than the traditional thing you would see.\"\n\nThe KASITA homes will be sold directly to consumers in the Fall, but Wilson declined to give a specific date as to when they'll be available.\n\nAs for price? \"It will be about the price of a mid-range Tesla, except this is a home,\" Wilson said. He declined to give a specific price, but the lowest price for a Tesla is the $35,000 Model 3.\n\nWilson said KASITA will work with buyers to find and purchase the land to place their KASITA homes.\n\n\"What we ended up with is a new way of thinking about the home as more like a product than a pile of bricks and sticks stuck to a particular piece of land,\" he said. \"Something that\u2019s more personal, that you know, that knows you, that integrates more with the person that you are.\"",

        "text": "Kasita \u2013 A Tiny \u201cPlug and Play\u201d Prefab House by Jeff Wilson\nby NIALL BURKE\n\nDr. Jeff Wilson made his name after living out of a converted dumpster for a year. Now, the Texas-based environmental science professor has launched a prefab housing concept.\n\nThe project, dubbed Kasita, aims to resolve the difficulties people face when attempting to get on the housing market. Its inception also reflects society\u2019s changing attitude towards home ownership.\n\nDescribed as \u201chousing-as-a-service\u201d, Kasita is composed of a prefab module which can be transported by truck from one location to another. Different sites would be setup to act as hubs \u2013 a place where Kasita\u2019s can be \u201cplugged in\u201d to a vertical rack of homes. Its kind of like a vertical trailer park.\n\nThe Kasita contains a 208 square foot (19.3 square meters) living space with an interior kitted out with space-saving furniture and storage units. There\u2019s a sofa-bed that can be rolled under a platform, as well as flexible storage wall that allows you to swap out tiles in place of shelves, storage boxes, or hanging pins.\n\nBeing a home of the future, it\u2019s also equipped with several smart technologies that will allow the occupant to control a host of features from their smartphone. Technologies slated for use include a Nest thermostat, wifi-enabled lighting and dichromic glass in the solarium to control light levels.\n\nThe concept opens up doors for new ways of living. You could own a Kasita module itself, or perhaps a rack in the steel tower which could be rented out when it\u2019s not in use. A reoccurring theme among these projects is the ability to live in different places \u2013 you find it in tiny houses, the recent co-living buildings and now with Kasita.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested, you can visit the prototype in Austin, Texas. The team behind the project are also intending to create a 320 square foot version, along with a wheelchair-accessible model. The aim is to create the homes in large quantities on a production line in order to reduce the cost. The pricing has yet to be revealed.\n\nFor more tiny houses check out The Basecamp, a tiny house built for and by a pair of mountaineers. Or, Alpha, a luxurious tiny house on wheels by New Frontier Tiny Homes. See all tiny houses.\n\nVia TreeHugger\n\nPhotos: Kasita, Video: Fair Companies",

Roughly 919,500 apartments have been registered so far in 2024, up from between 750,000 and 800,000 registrations in recent years.\n\nNew cultural signs honoring Brooklyn's rich African heritage have been installed along Flatbush Avenue as part of the Black History + Heritage Corridors project, which connects the Lefferts Historic House and the Flatbush African Burial Ground and celebrates the history and culture of Brooklynites of African descent.\n\nA Tim Burton-themed light trail inspired by \"Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas\" will illuminate the New York Botanical Garden this fall.

Jeff Wilson, better known as Professor Dumpster, is showing off his small homes Friday, the day Kasitas go on sale.\n\nJeff Wilson is taking the concept behind a \"casita\", Spanish for \"small house\", to a whole new level.\n\"It's the smartest home in Austin, maybe one of the smartest homes in the world,\" Wilson says while standing outside the prototype for his line of homes called Kasita.\n\"Generally you've got your, you know Alexa, you have these smart bulbs, you maybe have a Sonos system but it all doesn't talk together,\" Wilson said.\nInstead of building a house and filling it with smart technology, Wilson and his team built a home around technology.\n\nKasitas have one app that manages the entire home. It can show you who's at the door and let you talk the person outside or change your home's settings.\n\"Your 'welcome home' button flashes on all the lights. It puts on the fan,\" said Wilson.\n\nIf you want to set the mood, there's a button for that.\n\"If you hit 'date night' on the app,\" Wilson said as he hit the button. Marvin Gaye's \"Lets Get It On\" started playing and the lights dimmed.\n\nIf you're looking to do something more casual with friends, Wilson recommends selecting \"movie time\". This causes the television to rise out of a cabinet and start playing.\n\nThe Kasita prototype is a much nicer place to live compared to where Wilson was sleeping back in 2014\nBack then, the Huston-Tillotson professor was known around town as \"Professor Dumpster\". He was teaching his science students about sustainability and minimalism by living in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year.\n\n\"While I was in the dumpster, I had the thought that why don't we think about homes like iPhones,\" said Wilson.\nMeaning why don't people make them on a manufacturing line and design them in a way that ensures every inch of space is utilized.\n\nThe couch in a Kasita turns into a queen size bed. The stairs are really storage. All of the windows in the home dim with the touch of a button or go completely clear.\n\nThere's no denying the tech innovations inside Kasitas are cool, but for Wilson, the real purpose is to make housing affordable and accessible.\n\"We're not just looking at making cheap housing, we're looking at how land works, how the whole financing system works, how energy works. Coding and permitting and all these things tied together is what 's brought us into this housing, it's not even a crisis, it's a catastrophe,\" Wilson said.\n\nHis homes offer middle class people and couples an affordable option to live small. Wilson says they are ideal for someone who likes to travel or someone who enjoys spending time in their community rather than in the house.\n\nThe Kasitas go on sale Friday for $139,000. They can be reserved with a $1,000 refundable down payment. The units are 352 square feet and can fit in a back yard or small lot. They also can be stacked on top of each other. All of the homes are built in Austin, Texas.\n\nWilson said he hopes to one day use Kasita to address homelessness and even have larger units for families.\n\nClick here to read more about Kasita",

It has spawned books, television shows, and countless internet stories about \"going small.\" Despite this, we promise you've never heard of anything like Kasita. This Austin, Texas based micro-housing startup is shaking up the market with its 31' x 12' portable smart home. Launched last year by former professor Jeff Wilson and his team, Kasita can be customized to serve a number of needs, whether it be for a residence, an office, or a pop-up shop\u2014and it can be installed virtually anywhere. Small enough to fit on the back of a truck, it's incredibly easy to transport. Additionally, it contains all the essentials you need for a functioning home: a bedroom, bathroom, living room, and kitchen\u2014there is even storage space, air conditioning, and a washer/dryer. Even the appliances and electronic features (think glass windows with adjustable transparency and Amazon voice controls) are up to the latest smart-home technological standards.\nUntil they're produced and ready for pickup, you can reserve an individual Kasita (or multiple units to install in a group) for a $1,000 fee to hold your place in line. Once they're made, a Kasita can be yours for an additional $139,000. Check out photos of the tiny smart home here.",

        "text": "Here is the extracted article text:\n\nNew Kasita owners repurpose tiny prefab houses for hospitality concept\nAn innovative Austin home-building company becomes a disruptive Austin-based hotel company\nBy Cindy Widner@CurbedAustin Updated Aug 5, 2019, 12:10pm CDT\n\nBorn of an experiment in which founder Jeff Wilson lived in a dumpster for a year, Kasita launched in Austin in 2015, touting its smart, prefab, modular tiny homes that seemed like they could be one answer to the affordability crisis hitting both its home city and others across the country. Kasitas that would be based on the 352-square-foot prototype parked on an East Austin lot were projected to cost around $139,000 (which didn\u2019t include purchasing the land they would stand on, of course\u2014although at the time changes in Austin\u2019s zoning ordinances were starting make the more widespread use of accessory dwelling units on residential properties possible).\n\nBy 2017, Kasita was a national phenomenon\u2014at least in the press, think tanks, and the academy\u2014if not yet one that was actually producing and selling a lot of its streamlined, modern tiny homes. Touted as the \u201ciPhone for housing\u201d (it was 2017), the Kasita model and its touted revolutionary potential were featured, praised, and debated in multiple media sources, including CityLab and the New York Times. Its tours, collaborations, and activations during SXSW were big hits for a couple of years. Curbed and the Verge even produced and aired a video about Kasita for their Home of the Future series.\n\nThroughout 2017 and into 2018, the company continued to announce advances such as moving to a stackable version of its modular units that would be more affordable than the originals, expansion to other states, and the start of production in its own manufacturing facility. Around the start of 2019, the buzz around Kasita quieted considerably, and, if LinkedIn is any indication, Williams\u2019s tenure as CEO seems to have ended late last year.\n\nBy June, Kasitas were appearing on the MLS, brokered by real estate professionals, not the company. According to the company\u2019s new website, \u201cserial entrepreneurs\u201d Kenny Tomlin and Richard Lent\u2014who also own the Kimber Modern boutique hotel in South Austin\u2014became co-owners of Kasita in early 2019.\n\nRather than continuing to operate the company as a (very specialized) home builder that sells primarily individual residential dwellings (which it no longer does), Tomlin and Lent reinvented Kasita as a hospitality-oriented company. Individual Kasitas are now hotel suites, intended to be grouped and operated as a sort of hotel compound, with guests staying in individual, detached units rather than a single building. Guests will use various technologies come and go independent of any staff\u2014not unlike the intended independent, tech-based experience at the newly opened Arrive East Austin\u2014although there will be common areas available to guests as well.\n\nAccording to its website, Kasita will launch its flagship site in Austin, where it has already signed a design, development, and management agreement for a property. It\u2019s scheduled to open in 2020. The website also indicates that the company intends to expand to San Antonio, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Portland, Oregon; Bentonville, Arkansas; and San Diego, California and invites parties interested in developing the hotels in other parts of the country to get in touch.",

        "text": "After living in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year to test the limits and see how much space someone actually needs to live, Jeff Wilson has created Kasita, a tiny house that measures in at just 352 square feet (32 square meters) and has everything you would find in a normal house.\n\nKasita has been designed in a way so that it can be used for many different types of spaces, like a guest house, secondary income suite, office or a studio.\n\nEach tiny home has integrated technology that includes personal light and temperature settings, built-in speakers and a video-enabled doorbell. \n\nEntering the unit, there\u2019s a small hallway, and off to the right of the hallway is the bathroom, fully equipped with a shower, toilet and vanity. Just outside the bathroom is a storage closet with built-in shelves.\n\nThe kitchen is located next to the closet, and it has a small induction cooktop and a convection microwave oven, as well as more storage and two counter spaces. The second counter space doubles as a desk/small work area and below the counter are fridge and freezer drawers.\n\nAt the end of the kitchen counter, you can see the washer / dryer, and the wooden stairs that lead down to the living area have hidden pull-out storage drawers.\n\nNext up is the living room that has a ceiling height of just over 10 feet. A custom designed couch fits the space perfectly and hides a bed. The couch can be transformed into a queen-size bed by simply extending it out. Part of the couch frame now becomes bedside tables.\n\nAt the end of the unit is a raised platform that\u2019s surrounded by floor to ceiling windows, allowing plenty of light to fill the small space. A flat-screen television is hidden within the white storage cube with drawers, that also has a small bench next to it.",

        "text": "Landry Allred\nOctober 17, 2018\nCourtesy of Kasita\nNo one would have thought living in a dumpster for a year would spark a housing business \u2014 no one but Jeff Wilson.\nWilson founded Kasita \u2014 a micro-home business based in Austin that manufactures small, intelligent homes called Kasitas for unlikely spaces in the urban community. Now, Kasita continues to improve the homes and extend its outreach.\n\nWilson, co-founder of Kasita, recognized the potential for smaller homes after living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year. While teaching at Huston-Tillotson University, Wilson sold his possessions and moved into a campus dumpster in early February 2014.\n\n\u201cIt was a grand experiment in testing the question of, \u2018How much do you really need to be happy?\u2019\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI wanted to take something that was both very small and also a symbol of waste, which happened to be a dumpster.\u201d\n\nThe business launched in April 2015, three months following Wilson\u2019s departure from his dumpster. Today, Kasita has 27 employees divided among the technology and production teams. According to Kasita\u2019s website, the building process for a single home takes at least seven weeks, with prices starting at $150,000.\n\nWilson said Kasitas are unique because they are built as an immersive experience rather than a home.\n\u201cKasita\u2019s the only micro-home out there and one of the only homes in the world where it has technology integrated in it from the very beginning,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou walk in the door, and everything just works.\u201d\n\nWhile this wave of micro-living spans across the country, some disagree with its functionality, such as architectural engineering professor Atila Novoselac. He said when factoring in air quality, smaller spaces are problematic because energy emissions from appliances have a larger impact in smaller houses than larger houses.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re solving some problems about living space but also turning a new set of problems, which are solvable,\u201d Novoselac said. \u201cBut it generates a completely new perspective of how you should design those houses.\u201d\n\nThough Novoselac opposes the micro-home movement, he said tiny houses are necessary for limited spaces like crammed cities. Luckily, Wilson said Kasitas are specifically built for slivers of land.\n\n\u201cI really wanted to find a place in the cracks to put housing,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cKasita\u2019s really great because we can put it on very small pieces of land where most people aren\u2019t looking to put things.\u201d\n\nEven students find micro-homes desirable and recognize their potential, including Terrell Brown, an architecture and architectural engineering junior.\n\n\u201cJust thinking of the possibilities of what (micro-homes) could be used for, it was really eye-opening for me,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI feel like it could potentially be the future of architectural style.\u201d\n\nThis idea of micro-homes does not stop there \u2014 Kasita now has 10 houses nationally and aims to build 80 more within the next year. The business hopes to extend its outreach beyond California, Nevada, and Texas, and eventually expand internationally.\n\nWilson said Kasita plans to add more electronic features, move toward an artificially intelligent home and continue to make micro-living easier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about building a small home,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe\u2019re building out a larger network to where one day \u2014 say five years from now \u2014 when you leave UT, you can be living in a Kasita right off the UT campus.\u201d",

Despite declining sales and a lack of credit options for builders, these unconventional firms are thriving due to their flexibility and ability to adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nThese companies, which often operate outside traditional channels, have capitalized on the state's severe housing shortage by building homes that are affordable, energy-efficient, and tailored to meet local needs. By using innovative materials and construction methods, they can build faster and more sustainably than traditional builders, making them attractive options for homeowners seeking quality at a lower price.\n\nWhile large-scale developers continue to struggle with declining sales and a lack of access to credit, untraditional construction firms are finding ways to succeed. They are focusing on smaller projects that allow for greater flexibility and reduced risk, often partnering with local non-profits or community organizations to help address the housing shortage.\n\nAs California's housing crisis persists, it remains to be seen whether traditional builders will find ways to adapt and compete with these innovative companies. For now, untraditional construction appears to be thriving in the Golden State.",

Taylor Wilson, son of veteran Austin area homebuilder Clark Wilson, is partnering with Wilson in the new company. Jeff Wilson and Taylor Wilson are not related.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really interesting about this is it\u2019s really testing the limits of what you need in a home,\u201d Jeff Wilson has said of the concept.\n\nThe tiny units will be about 200 square feet, with 10-foot ceilings and can be relocated to other sites in other cities, Kasita\u2019s founders say.\n\n\u201cThrough partnerships with local entities, Kasita will be able to provide attainable housing at $600 a month once manufacturing is at scale,\u201d Taylor Wilson said. That\u2019s about half the amount a studio apartment near downtown currently rents for, he said.\n\nThe micro units will be aimed at urban Millennials, as well as other professionals and singles who want to live near city centers. Units could also be used for student housing and other populations, Kasita executives said.\n\n\u201cWith Kasita, we\u2019re able to bring higher utility to smaller tracts of land in highly desirable areas, at more attainable prices,\u201d Taylor Wilson said.\n\nThe first prototype, with nine units, is being designed and manufactured at W2 MacFab, a company in East Austin, Taylor Wilson said.\n\nKasita\u2019s founders say the units will \u201cfeel spacious and full of light\u201d equipped with traditional amenities such as a queen size bed, walk-in shower, refrigerator, convection oven and cooktop, dishwasher and laundry machines.\n\nEach Kasita unit will plug into traditional utilities.\n\nKasita was announced at the South by Southwest Eco conference this week.\n\nThe Kasitas will be available in Austin beginning in 2016 and in potentially ten other cities starting in 2017. Future Kasita homes could include Portland, Los Angeles, Brooklyn and Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nIn Austin, the first Kasita prototypes are slated for two as yet undisclosed sites, one near downtown and the other in East Austin, Taylor Wilson said.\n\nIn March, Taylor Wilson had announced plans for another \u201cmicro unit\u201d project, to be known as Spire and planned for East Austin. Wilson said he still plans to move forward with that project, but is still trying to nail down a site after the initial one did not work out.",

Geared toward professional types, it can be moved to another location with relative ease.\n\nKasita brings to mind elements of the tiny house and shipping container home communities. It comprises just 208 sq ft (19 sq m) of floorspace, including a bathroom, a kitchenette, study, and a lounge. A cantilevering glass front section is a nice touch.\n\nThe home is smart too. \"Your Kasita will welcome you home by adjusting the A/C, bringing up the lights and shades, and queueing your favorite playlist,\" says the firm's blurb. \"Or, ask your Kasita to do something else (like rolling out the bed) via hands-free voice commands throughout.\"\n\nEach Kasita is a self-contained unit that slots into a larger \"rack,\" which provides the necessary plumbing and electricity. This modular system means that if you want to move, your home can follow.\n\nThe plan is, when you want to move, Kasita can simply move with you.",

        "text": "This tiny modular home is 325 square feet of IoT heaven\nBy The Verge\nSep 6, 2017, 9:00 PM GMT+8\n\nWelcome to Home of the Future, a four-part video series co-produced by Curbed and The Verge. Each month, we'll take you inside one innovative home and explore how the technology of today informs the way people will live in the future.\n\nTo follow along, stay tuned for new video episodes on our Facebook page. This month\u2019s location? A tiny prefab billed as the \u201ciPhone for housing.\u201d\n\nTiny houses have long been a dwelling of choice for those who appreciate a minimalist lifestyle, but they\u2019ve become even more trendy in recent years after an ongoing affordable housing crisis (and, admittedly, HGTV\u2019s House Hunters spinoff on the miniature homes). But tiny doesn\u2019t have to mean it\u2019s missing out on any special features of a futuristic home either.\n\nKasita, an Austin-based startup, is hoping to fit all the latest tech into just 352 square feet of living space. In fact, the company calls its micro-homes the \u201ciPhone for housing.\u201d\n\nKasita is outfitted with the latest voice-activated tech, so you can program your home to recognize \u201cmoods.\u201d Tell Kasita to prepare for theater mode and it\u2019ll know to dim the lights, raise the flatscreen TV out from a hidden wall, and open your favorite streaming app.\n\nThe model unit Kasita founder Jeff Wilson showed us has more than 60 smart home devices that are preprogrammed to talk to each other, and span areas including home security, indoor temperature, and even the shower room to help save water consumption. Wilson says to buy these devices separately, it would cost over $20,000, plus the amount of time it takes to connect the devices together under one system.\n\nKasita\u2019s turnkey micro-unit costs $139,000 with everything ready to go and controllable from the main Kasita app.\n\nThe home isn\u2019t just designed for those looking to live on remote land or strap the unit to their van and move around the country either. In dense, urban areas like Houston and Brooklyn, Kasita units can be stacked to create a tower of micro-apartments, or used as commercial space for tiny restaurants and shops.\n\nThe company is currently working with local governments to pilot Kasita communities as an affordable housing solution. Earlier this year, the company opened a 25,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in East Austin that can churn out a unit in just eight weeks.",

        "text": "Here is the cleaned-up article:\n\nTiny, Prefab, Plug-and-Play Housing Coming to a City Near You\n\nWhen we last caught up with Professor Jeff Wilson he was living in a dumpster. The reason he was holing up in such an unlikely structure wasn\u2019t merely for shock value (though that was part of it). He was trying to see how minimal a home could be while still achieving a high level of comfort and function.\n\nWhat he found was that 33 sq ft (the size of the dumpster) was too damn small. \u201cAt the end of the day, I was still peeing in a bottle,\u201d he told me. But he knew that with the right design, he could make something that was still very small, yet more capable than his trash bin home.\n\nThis conceit is informing his latest endeavor. Wilson and his partner Taylor Wilson (no relation) have founded Kasita, a prefabricated, modular housing system that is out to revolutionize compact urban architecture.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem is affordability in urban cores in cities across the world, and housing is at the nexus of this problem,\u201d he told me. The lack of housing drives people to go the outskirts and suburbs of cities, where housing is larger and far more resource intensive.\n\nWilson saw the need for something that could easily densify these urban cores, but nothing out there was cutting it from his perspective. In devising a solution, Wilson bypassed the counsel of architects and sought out the \u201cbaddest ass product designer\u201d he could find.\n\nBecause space efficiency was of the utmost importance, he wanted someone more accustomed to dealing in millimeters than 2\u201d x 4\u201d studs. That person turned out to be noted industrial designer Remy Labesque.\n\nThe design Labesque created is a sleek, fully-furnished 208 sq ft unit. There\u2019s a small kitchen, seating area, storage and a bathroom. There\u2019s a unique tile system along one wall that can support a variety of plugin accessories ranging from a bike hook to speakers.\n\n\u201cThe bed was the real challenge,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cMost of the tiny housing bed solutions just didn\u2019t seem that great to me. For example, tiny houses usually have low-ceilinged loft beds, which aren\u2019t ideal if you like to drink, make love or do both at the same time.\u201d\n\nBecause they made their ceilings ten feet high, they were able to use a volume underneath the kitchen for an easily-accessed trundle bed without compromising the overall spaciousness of the unit.\n\nPerhaps the most innovative aspect of the Kasita is its frame that the units are plugged into. The frame is centrally connected to the municipal grid (sewers, water, gas and electric) and utilities are then distributed to the units through the frame\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nThis makes for quick and cheap set up and construction. This speed will make Kasita ideal for installation in empty or underutilized urban lots. Wilson told me that a nine unit frame can fit onto as little as 1K sq ft; even accounting for requisite setbacks, this is a small footprint.\n\nHe also said they\u2019re ideal for \u201cflag properties\u201d\u2013odd shaped parcels of land that are tough to fill with conventional structures. The prefabricated construction, small size and ease of setup result in lower costs.\n\nWilson projects that once production is up to speed, Kasita units will rent at 50% of normal market rates for comparable studios, which in Austin is $600.",

Now his digs are decidedly more impressive: Kasita has created stackable and completely mobile living spaces of a modest 32.7 square metres.\n\nA post shared by Kasita (@kasita) on Mar 23, 2017 at 2:26pm PDT\n\nRe-imagining the home as a functional space, the Kasita prototypes are self-dubbed \u2018the iPhone for housing\u2019 and considering each home can be controlled completely via smartphone app, it\u2019s not far from the truth. With a connected app, residents can monitor the temperature, lighting, integrated sound system, as well as transparency of the glass walls of one corner for privacy. There\u2019s also an energy recovery ventilation system, and water and energy is perfectly trackable for maximum efficiency. The kicker though? It can be popped on an 18-wheeler and moved to wherever your heart (and your permit) desires. The team at Kasita has even conceived of kind-of carparks where your Kasita can live for a few months, then slot into another carpark somewhere else, making for super-modern mobility.\n\n\u201cThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, the permitting and the land,\u201d Jeff says of the project. \u201cAnd the land\u2019s the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks who need affordable housing. So, our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetise that land, while providing home ownership to someone.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Kasita (@kasita) on May 10, 2017 at 2:04pm PDT\n\nA post shared by Kasita (@kasita) on Apr 9, 2017 at 9:42am PDT\n\nPointing out that the housing model hasn\u2019t had much of an update since 1884, when the first US skyscraper was built, Kasita aims to reimagine the urban landscape and allow more affordable and adaptable housing opportunities.

        "text": "Kasita Is a High-Tech Tiny Home for the Minimalist Crowd\nJeff Wilson was tired of how the high cost of living in cities can drive people out of the neighborhoods they love. So he decided to create a high-tech tiny house \u2014 or as he describes it: \"an iPhone I can live in.\"\n\nHe took the concepts of minimalism and added smart technology like temperature control and windows that dim automatically, and made the 270-square-foot \"Kasita.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see this in cities around the world with folks able to own a beautiful home in the heart of the city,\" said Wilson, standing outside a prototype. The tiny home \u2014 equipped with an Amazon Echo, Nest thermostat and View Dynamic Glass \u2014 is currently parked in Austin, Texas for the South by Southwest festival.\n\nWhile this Kasita model is going solo for now, Wilson envisions multiple units being stacked side-by-side and on top of each other with a community space at the very top. Wilson says Kasitas could be shipped by truck from one city to another when owners want a change of scenery, though the company hasn't determined how much that could cost.\n\nHis inspiration came from an unusual place: a dumpster. After selling most of his possessions, Wilson lived in a used 33-square-foot dumpster for a year as a social experiment, then worked with an industrial designer to create his dream space with a tiny footprint.\n\n\"When you have less, you really can have more life,\" said Wilson, adding that owners of tiny houses may find themselves with more disposable income.\n\nThe tiny home's price won't be announced until April 5, when they're set to go on sale. The first Kasita is expected to be available in Austin later this year.",

The homes can be combined with other modules to form larger structures.\n\n\"We're not just building homes; we're building neighborhoods,\" says Ryan Wilson, Kasita co-founder.\n\nThe company has raised over $13 million in funding from investors such as Gary Keller, founder of Keller Williams real estate firm.\n\nKasita plans to produce 100 units per year at its Austin factory and hopes to ramp up production to 300-500 units by 2019 using regional locations.\n\nPrices for Kasita homes range from $89,000 for a base unit with no appliances or technology to $129,000 for a fully equipped model with hardwood floors and premium appliances.\n\nThe company has reported interest from developers in Houston and New York City but plans to launch its first project in Denver.\n\n\"We figured out what is important to people,\" says Wilson. \"We're taking the risk out of the process.\"\n\nKasita's approach differs from traditional modular construction methods, which focus solely on design. The company combines a user-centered design approach with manufacturing realities.\n\n\"We take a lot of the risk out of the process,\" says Kasita co-founder Steve Miller.",

        "text": "This Is Kasita, the iPhone for Housing: Compact, Smart, Modular, and Mobile\n\nPublished: 14 Oct 2023, 08:20 UTC \u2022 By: Elena Gorgan\n\nTiny houses have long been held as the epitome of minimalism, but in a more general sense, you don't get any more minimalist than an iPhone. Add an iPhone to the tiny house movement, and you get Kasita, a very smart, modular, and ultra-compact home dubbed the \"iPhone of housing.\"\n\nThe Kasita idea goes back to 2014 when creator Jeff Wilson was living out of a dumpster and started thinking about a unit that would be ideal for densely populated urban areas.\n\nKasita looks like a container house and features a layout similar to what you might find in one. The difference is that it's not made out of a container but of prefabricated aluminum composite panels assembled on-site over a steel structural framework.\n\nThe Kasita has a linear layout, with an elevated platform at one end hiding the electrics and offering extra storage. The platform holds the kitchen and dining area, the bathroom, and a utility closet, while the front end is taken up by the bedroom slash lounge and an atrium-like living.\n\nWilson unveiled a functional Kasita prototype with this layout in 2015. In between having it on display at various local trade events, he used it as his home. It was a welcome upgrade to living in a dumpster tiny home, to be sure.\n\nKasita was presented as a one-for-all solution, with customers ranging from urban millennials looking to put their own spin on home ownership to retirees, environmentalists, middle-class workers, and the well-heeled looking to switch it up with a smart tiny.\n\nHowever, the base price of the Kasita was anything but affordable: $139,000 for a turnkey unit. This probably went a long way toward stalling the project, but Kasita lives on as a viable, if too costly, example of minimalist, smart, and mobile living.",

The prefabricated homes can be constructed in three weeks \u2014 and could go a long way toward easing the affordable housing crunch that has bedeviled much of the country, according to Wilson.\n\nSXSW HIGH-TECH TINY HOME GOSE BIG!\n\nWith the help of former employees at Google, Elon Musk\u2019s SolarCity and Bell Helicopter, Wilson thinks he has a solution to provide homes and stackable apartments in unused pieces of land such as vacant parking lots. \u201cIf you file for a backyard unit, it can be approved in weeks,\u201d says Wilson, who predicts his home could hit the market this summer.\n\n\u201cWe need to find cracks in the system rather than take a sledgehammer to it,\u201d he says.\n\nIf the reaction of consumers at Kasita\u2019s recent party at SXSW is any indication, interest is high. Hundreds patiently waited in line to get a peek at the modular home, which features a bathroom shower, kitchen, bedroom and living room patio.\n\nA remote control allows dwellers to quickly change mood lighting and an entertainment system.

To help singles squeeze their lives into such small spaces, Kasita boasts tons of interior-design bells and whistles, from modular \u201ctile\u201d shelving to various networked-home features.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Professor Dumpster, aka Jeff Wilson, the former dean of Huston-Tillotson University who once made his home in a 33-square-foot dumpster as a teaching exercise. He\u2019s the brain behind Kasita, and he\u2019s assembled a diverse team of designers and executives to build his dream in Austin and at least nine other cities. Kasita has raised at least $645,000 in private investment so far (and more is promised).",

        "text": "How big of a house does one really need? Typically, when someone is looking for a house, they are merely looking at what is available, not what is possible. We\u2019ve talked about the Tiny House Movement before, but as of yet, in Buffalo, we haven\u2019t seen anything become of it other than talk. A fairly small house is located at the corner of Bryant and Ashland. And developer Rocco Termini once talked about building a complex with tiny units, but that\u2019s about it.\n\nThere\u2019s one thing to be said for tiny house. There\u2019s another thing to be said for tiny houses that can be stacked into rack systems, which combine to form modular buildings. That\u2019s essentially what\u2019s possible with the Kasita home \u2013 a house that was dreamed up by professor Jeff Wilson who wanted to create the \u2018iPhone for housing\u2019. The owner of the unit could literally have his or her pad picked up and moved to another rack system in another city, something akin to \u201cvertical RV parks\u201d.\n\nWhile this type of living might not be for everyone, there are plenty of people who would appreciate a more compact lifestyle, including transient young people, military personnel, environmentalists, people who travel for a living, people who want to live closer to work and who can\u2019t afford typically expensive urban living\u2026\n\nA total of 5000 hours of engineering went in completing the beta version. Kasita incorporates electrochromic glass panels that lighten and darken by use of an app, or according to the sun\u2019s position in the sky (it\u2019s dynamic glass). Altogether, the prototype Kasita is 208 square feet, with the potential for outdoor living space or common areas that people can share. The production version that Wilson is on the process of rolling out would be 320 square feet. Even at that size, the micro unit will be able to be transported by an 18-wheeler truck, according to Wilson.\n\n\u201cThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, the permitting and the land,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cAnd the land\u2019s the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks that need affordable housing. So our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetize that land while providing home ownership to someone.\u201d\n\nUltimately, one of the greatest Kasita benefits is that of home ownership. According to Wilson, someone who typically rents a one bedroom apartment would be able to purchase a Kasita unit (in a rack environment). The cost would obviously be higher if someone was to purchase property and \u201cinstall\u201d one of these. The other option would be for property owners to \u201cconstruct\u201d these as rentals. The plan is to assemble thousands of Kasinas, which would keep the price down.\n\n\u201cSo folks aren\u2019t going to be flying around all the time in their Kasitas, but in 5 years let\u2019s say you want to move your Kasita, we can pull you out of that rack, put you on an 18-wheeler truck and move you to another rack or put it in a backyard,\u201d explained Wilson. \u201cSo you\u2019re no longer bound to the land that you own your house on and we think that that\u2019s how people will want to live.\u201d\n\nThe Kasita home is not just a tiny house, but a modern, eco-friendly dwelling designed for the future of housing.",

        "text": "Kasita unveils prefabricated tiny houses that slot into \"racks\" like wine bottles\nJenna McKnight | 12 August 2016\n\nAustin-based startup Kasita has created a prototype of a prefabricated micro dwelling that can be slotted into a framework like a bottle into a wine rack (+ slideshow).\n\nThe mobile structure is a rectilinear pod clad in metal and glass, with one side featuring a cantilevered glazed box.\n\nIt is intended to slot horizontally into an engineered steel frame, or \"rack\", which can include many units stacked high and wide.\n\nDesigned to be assembled in under a week, each Kasita would be able to swap between different racks.\n\nOwners with mobile lifestyles could contact the company to have the home transported to a new location, using a crane and flatbed truck.\n\nOnce in place, the home would tie into city utilities via a special docking technology. \"The utilities are distributed throughout the rack to each individual Kasita,\" the company said.\n\nThe house would come equipped with smart-home technology that can be controlled by a mobile app.\n\nFeatures include a smart thermostat by Nest \u2013 the domestic technology company that Google acquired in 2014 \u2013 and a voice-controlled Echo speaker by Amazon.\n\nThe design also calls for wireless LED lighting system and electrochromic windows that automatically turn from opaque to transparent, depending upon the outdoor lighting conditions.\n\nThe open-plan interior has 10-foot-high ceilings (three metres). The kitchen offers standard amenities such as a dishwasher, an induction cooktop and a convection oven, while the sleeping area is fitted with a queen-sized mattress.\n\nThe company is working to develop wall panels that will accommodate shelving, bike racks and storage.\n\n\"Kasita is designed for a variety of individuals at different places in their life,\" the company said. \"From college kids in need of student housing, to urban millennials, to those enjoying retirement \u2013 Kasita is the perfect home.\"\n\nThe company hopes to attract developers, who can purchase multiple units and stack them up to 10 stories high.\n\nKasita was founded by architect Gopal Ahuja and entrepreneur Tony Huang in 2015.\n\nThe company's name comes from a combination of \"ka\" from kaizen, which means continuous improvement, and \"sita\", the Sanskrit word for garden.",

The company is working to produce affordable, modular housing in cities.\n\nCredit...Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times\nBy Paulette Perhach\nJuly 20, 2016\n\nJeff Wilson's vision for the future of housing has taken shape in a small factory here, where machines whir and whizz as they assemble homes from scratch. Kasita, the company he started three years ago with two other entrepreneurs, is pioneering a new way to build affordable, modular houses.\n\nThe prototypes on display are sleek, modern boxes that seem ready for flight. Each one is precisely 220 square feet, with large windows, a Murphy bed and a compact kitchen. They have all the makings of a luxury home, but Kasita's goal is to make them more like a smart phone: affordable, efficient and connected.\n\n\"We're creating a new category in housing,\" Mr. Wilson said, as he showed off the prototypes. \"We're using the latest technologies to build homes that are cheaper, faster and more sustainable than anything else out there.\"\n\nTo achieve this, Kasita is leveraging three major innovations: 3-D printing, which allows for rapid production of complex structures; modular construction, which involves building individual components in a factory and assembling them on-site; and connected systems, which integrate the various parts of a home into a seamless whole.\n\nThe result is a product that is both futuristic and functional. The homes are designed to be assembled quickly \u2013 in as little as 24 hours \u2013 and can be easily customized to meet the needs of individual buyers.\n\nKasita's business model is built around partnerships with cities, developers and other organizations that are eager for affordable housing options. The company has already partnered with the city of Austin, Tex., which will provide financing for Kasita homes and help to expedite the building process.\n\nThe goal is not just to build houses, but to transform the way people live in them. \"We're creating a platform,\" said Mr. Wilson, who envisions Kasita homes as part of a larger ecosystem that includes public transportation, community spaces and other amenities.\n\nIn this vision, the boundaries between home and neighborhood begin to blur. The house is no longer just a physical shelter, but a connection point for its occupants with the wider world.\n\n\"We're not just building houses,\" Mr. Wilson said. \"We're creating communities.\"",

While the mobile devices are handy, are people \u2013 especially the affluent baby-boomers who are making the real estate market, going to give up their more-traditional homestead to live in a 320sf tin can?\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/petertaylor/2016/07/19/meet-kasita-the-micro-housing-start-up-thats-about-to-revolutionize-real-estate/\n\nYou can tell immediately that Jeff Wilson, the 42-year old founder of Kasita, an Austin-based micro-housing start-up, has been courting venture capital. He has his sales pitch nailed\u2014which is pretty impressive for a former university dean and professor who used to live in a dumpster.\n\nWhen I ask Wilson what fundamental problem his company is solving he tells me without flinching: \u201cKasita is on the verge of disrupting the urban housing market in ways not seen in real estate and development in 150 years.\u201d Wilson\u2019s confidence may just be spot on. And perfectly timed.\n\nOver the past decade my wife and I have asked each other countless times why everything else we own is completely mobile with the glaring exception of real estate. It\u2019s not an unreasonably philosophical question. Every current aspect of our personal and business lives\u2014from banking and corporate communications to reading the news or planning a vacation\u2014now runs entirely off of five mobile devices and a wireless hotspot. So why do we still sleep in a house every night with two-foot thick brick walls that hasn\u2019t moved an inch in 128 years?\n\nSeeing a massive, mobility-starved void in the dead center of one of the largest segments of the US economy (while living in a dumpster), Wilson is betting that his tech-stuffed, 320-square foot, portable living capsule (a.k.a. casita, or \u201csmall home\u201d) is poised to transform the fundamental concept of what real estate means to a new generation of Millennials, empty nesters, and upwardly mobile creative types (e.g., us) who are looking to trade-in their 30-year mortgage for mobility, simplicity, and financial independence.\n\nRead full article here:\n\nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/petertaylor/2016/07/19/meet-kasita-the-micro-housing-start-up-thats-about-to-revolutionize-real-estate/",

        "text": "Kasita: Former Dumpster Dweller Invents a Portable Smart Home\n\nBy Christopher Everett Tracy -\n\nFinding a new place to live and moving from place to place can be one of the most stressful times in a person\u2019s life. For those who can\u2019t deal with this draining process, there may be a solution for you in the form of a tiny portable apartment called Kasita.\n\nKasita is a housing startup by Dr. Jeff Wilson also known as \u2018Professor Dumpster\u2019, an environmental science professor at Huston-Tillotson University. He got his nickname from the Dumpster Project, in which he lived in a dumpster for a year to experiment with sustainable living in compact environments.\n\nThe compact nature of the dumpster appealed to his theory that the less cluttered our lives, the more time we have to devote to more meaningful things, resulting a happier life. \u201cBy converting a dumpster into a home, we are experimenting with innovative ways to live with less, and giving environmental education an engaging platform,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Wilson found the dumpster living experience surprisingly pleasant, and with the project deemed a success, he teamed up with a lead industrial designer named Remy Labesque in order to apply the concept to real housing. They wanted a space that would be low-rent (even in the heart of the city), transportable, and available for short term leasing for people living alone.\n\nThe resulting design was of an apartment can be individually moved and replaced. The compact homes, which are 208 square feet and built from glass and steel, are fitted into empty slots on a building made up of metal racks. \u201cIt enables us to go into very small spaces,\u201d explains Dr. Wilson. \u201cThe entire footprint of that rack is only about 1,000 square feet or so. So it allows us to move into unused, previously unusable pieces of land.\u201d\n\nIn cities that have Kasita support, users can press a button on an app to call a moving truck that removes your apartment and places it into an available slot in the city that you are moving to.\n\nEven as the outer mechanics of the building are impressive on its own, the inner space of the Kasitas is equally stunning because each apartment comes standard with loads of smart tech. With hands-free technology, you can darken the glass for privacy, adjust temperature and lighting, and even play music. Other features include a washer and dryer, a walk-in shower, and a full kitchen out of which slides a queen size bed.\n\nThe walls are lined with modular tiles that can be pulled out and rearranged, allowing the renter or owner to create a personalized living space. \u201cYou could take a modular tile out of the wall and plug in, say, a clock,\u201d Dr. Wilson says. \u201cOr you could take out three vertical tiles and plug in a mirror. You could take out six, and plug in a TV.\u201d\n\nIn the initial stages, the Kasita units will have to plug into an existing electrical grid. But in the future, the company plans to power the buildings through solar energy stored in Tesla batteries. Rainwater collection is also a potential feature that is being considered.\n\nThe company is planning to roll out the first rack of Kasita apartments to be built in Austin, Texas by spring 2016, with an additional 10 cities by 2017. The apartments are projected to go for half the market rate and will lease for around $600.",

        "text": "Kasita launches sales of high-tech micro dwellings at SXSW\n\nAt this year's SXSW festival, an Austin-based startup has launched sales for its prefabricated tiny house equipped with systems controlled by a mobile app.\n\nThe micro-housing startup called Kasita \u2013 adapted from the Spanish word for \"small house\" \u2013 was launched by a professor-turned-entrepreneur who once lived in a dumpster.\n\nThe company unveiled a tiny house prototype in 2015 and, after making various modifications, is now selling the units for $139,000 (\u00a3114,200). Discounts are available to customers who purchase multiple units.\n\nThe mobile home \u2013 which encompasses 352 square feet (33 square metres) \u2013 is being shown this week at the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference in Austin.\n\n\"Kasita is on a mission to solve the housing crisis in America with our seamlessly smart, beautifully designed light homes,\" the team said. \"We have taken a product design approach to housing in a way never before imagined.\"\n\nThe company is targeting a range of customers, including \"urban millennials, upwardly mobile singles, the shrinking middle class, and retirees\".\n\nDesigned by the company's in-house team, the rectilinear dwelling has a steel structural framework and is clad in aluminium composite panels. Windows are made of glass that tints automatically or on demand.\n\nThe split-level interior contains a glass-walled lounge area, a living room that doubles as a bedroom, a full kitchen, and a bathroom with a shower. Clerestories and 10-foot-high ceilings (three metres) help the space feel bright and airy.\n\nThe dwelling is larger than Kasita's initial prototype, which totalled 319 square feet (30 square metres). \"The layout has changed and we\u2019re constantly improving based on user feedback,\" the team said.\n\nMany of the home's systems and devices are controlled by a mobile app, including lights, window shading devices, an entertainment system, thermostats, smoke detectors and a video \"doorbell\".\n\nThe smart home also comes equipped with Amazon Echo Dot, a hands-free device that enables users to control systems with their voice.\n\n\"We're providing a completely integrated home automation experience,\" the team said. \"Kasita is easy and integrated on day one.\"\n\nIn the future, the company \u2013 which has grown from three employees to 22 in the past year \u2013 hopes to expand the concept and attract urban developers. Its vision is to create stackable units that can be slotted into a giant framework.\n\n\"Our first units fit in many untraditional spaces,\" said the team. \"We're looking for developers who are interested in innovating with us.\"\n\nThe company's launch at SXSW marks its entry into the festival circuit, and it will be hosting meetings and viewings of its micro dwellings throughout the event.",

        "text": "Could A Tiny Mobile Studio Solve Your Housing Crisis?\n\nIf you travel for work \u2014 and you're tired of living out of a suitcase, renting rooms and sharing bathrooms with grungy roommates \u2014 there's a man in Austin, Texas, who has a possible solution. Call it a long shot. But basically, he's building tiny self-contained apartments that move when you do.\n\nJeff Wilson gives me a tour of the first prototype. He's the mastermind behind the Kasita (\"little home\" in Spanish \u2014 only with a \"k\" instead of a \"c\").\n\nIt's a steel box, about 10 by 20 feet. It's different from typical mobile homes in two ways: It's made for downtown, not the outskirts of a city. And it's swank: dishwasher, washer/dryer and a subwoofer in the floor \u2014 because we can't live without a good sound system.\n\n\"The Kasita does not have a walk-in closet,\" Wilson says. \"We've used various tricks to make the place feel bigger: white walls, reflective surfaces, high ceilings (so you get vertically what you don't get horizontally). The front wall \u2014 the part that would face the street \u2014 is a dazzling glass balcony \u2014 fully enclosed, like a display case for a luxury watch, only human sized.\"\n\n\"This is really the personal expression space,\" Wilson says. \"So we're leaving that completely clean. No desk, no furniture. You can put plants up there or stand out there and do your yoga, read a book.\"\n\nWilson has a vision: that this little Kasita will be just one unit in a vast global network. From New York to San Francisco to Dubai to Beijing, large cities will have something called a \"rack\" \u2014 a building edifice, where you can pop in, say, six or nine units.\n\n\"There would be hookup valves for water, electricity and sewage,\" Wilson explains. \"Just plug in your home like you lock your bike. And when a Kasita renter needs to move, just press a button on your smartphone and have your home meet you ... wherever.\"\n\nHe's already leased the land for a rack in Austin. Some units there would go for below-market rates of $600 per month, excluding utilities.\n\n\"One of the things we're trying to solve for is having your own place,\" Wilson says, \"and not getting on Craigslist and finding a bunch of roommates that have too many cats and too much bong water left out on the dining room table.\"\n\nThis idea \u2014 that today's wandering class needs wandering homes, too \u2014 it resonates, though I ask him about a potential downside. If this takes off, couldn't people be even more isolated from one another?\n\n\"It could work,\" Wilson says. \"We've had some test runs with college students and they love it.\"\n\nI talk to Jeff about his inspiration for the Kasita project: a visit he made to Tokyo in 2012 where he saw tiny apartments, but also realized that this was a chance to rethink what home means.\n\n\"That's when we started talking about building houses that can move,\" Wilson explains. \"It's not just about affordability; it's about changing the way people think about their homes and their lives.\"\n\nWilson wants his company to eventually offer Kasitas with different sizes, prices, and amenities, so customers can pick what they want.\n\n\"That's the goal: have a platform of houses that are ready for you,\" Wilson says. \"It'll be like booking a vacation home online.\"\n\nI ask Jeff if he thinks the idea is sustainable in the long term.\n\n\"I think it could work,\" Wilson responds. \"We're already working on making them more energy-efficient and using recycled materials. If people want to buy one, we can make that happen too.\"",

        "text": "The first thing I think when I walk into the Kasita model on East Fourth Street is yes\u2014I would definitely live here. It\u2019s 5 p.m. on a Tuesday, and floor-to-ceiling windows flood the space with golden light. The 352-square-foot high-tech tiny home is fashionably furnished in that eminently Pinterest-able sort of way, with succulents on raised stands, chic neutral-toned furniture, and bright white walls. Best of all, it\u2019s not cluttered with all the stuff that fills my own far-dimmer, much older apartment. But as my dog, Phoebe, sniffs out the space where we\u2019re going to spend the night\u2014a brief experiment in tiny living\u2014I wonder: Where would I put all my stuff?\n\nThere\u2019s a large closet near the bathroom, tucked to the right of the entry; the stairs between the kitchen and the living room roll out to reveal storage bins; a hatch hides cleverly beneath a floor runner, opening into a basement-like space. In newer units, there are built-in bookshelves. The storage is smart but not abundant. Which is precisely the point of tiny living\u2014to pare down our lives to the essentials, following in the footsteps of Jeff Wilson, aka Professor Dumpster, who famously lived in a 33-square-foot dumpster for a year in Austin.\n\nWilson co-founded Kasita in 2015 with a vision to \u201ctransform urban living and to think about housing in our cities in a new way,\u201d he says. As of April, the Austin-based company, which has 32 employees, had made seven Kasita units, six of which are scattered around Austin. The seventh is embarking on a tour across the country.\n\nOne solution to the land question is to put your home in the backyard of an existing house\u2014although some residential lots in Austin require prohibitively expensive permitting. Another option is to lease a parcel in a tiny home community like Constellation ATX, a 6.2-acre development just south of Austin city limits that offers long-term leases on parcels of land starting at $725 a month.\n\nThe Kasita Community units are the next frontier, built to be stacked for multifamily dwelling in low- to mid-rise developments on small plots of land, increasing both affordability and density. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve the land issue,\u201d Wilson acknowledges. \u201cWe have to look for innovative ways to get to affordability. We need to think in new and innovative ways about the housing crisis.\u201d\n\nI turn the lights off via iPad, roll down the window shades, and sleep peacefully, enveloped in darkness and quiet. The next morning, Phoebe and I walk around East Austin, past small homes in disrepair adjacent to million-dollar rebuilds abutting empty lots selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. It seems fitting that the Kasita showroom is in East Austin, a neighborhood on the front lines of change, grappling with questions of affordability and density and who gets to live where.",

Units could also be used for student housing and other populations, executives said.\n\nDevelopers say units will \u201cfeel spacious and full of light\u201d equipped with traditional amenities such as a queen size bed, walk-in shower, refrigerator, convection oven and cooktop, dishwasher and laundry machines.\n\nEach Kasita will plug into traditional utilities.\n\nDevelopers say they\u2019ll eventually post prices to rent or buy Kasitas, but say that rents will be at half the market rate for a studio.\n\nWilson is teaming up with Kasita co-founder Taylor Wilson for the plan, which was announced at the South by Southwest Eco conference this week. The two Wilsons are not related.\n\nThe Kasitas will be available in Austin beginning in 2016 and in potentially ten other cities starting in 2017. Future Kasita homes could include Portland, Los Angeles, Brooklyn and Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nIn Austin, the project is slated for two different sites near downtown and in East Austin, Taylor Wilson said. However, a specific location has not been finalized, he added.\n\nTaylor Wilson announced a micro-unit concept project earlier this year. In March, Taylor Wilson announced a \u2018micro-unit\u2019 apartment project, Spire, for the East Austin area. However a site for that plan is still pending.\n\nEach unit was an estimated 400 square feet.",

My first thought is what happens if you have super noisy neighbors? They have a prototype unit located on East Fourth Street in downtown Austin.

However, manufactured home sales have shown a different trend. Cavco Industries reported a 15.6% increase in revenues from manufactured housing in their second quarter earnings report.\n\nIn contrast, the Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI) has not released any data on manufactured home sales, which has raised concerns among investors and industry insiders. The lack of transparency and inconsistent reporting practices have led to confusion and skepticism within the market.\n\nInvestors are now questioning the accuracy of MHI's reported numbers, citing discrepancies between their data and Cavco Industries' actual sales figures. This disparity is causing uncertainty in the MHMarkets, making it challenging for investors to make informed decisions.\n\nThe article goes on to discuss the implications of this situation on the manufactured housing market, including potential price volatility and decreased investor confidence. It also highlights the need for more transparent and consistent reporting practices within the industry.",

        "text": "Kasita\u2019s Modular Home on Display in Detroit\n\nBy Kevin Brass\nMay 1, 2018\n\nMicro-housing builder Kasita is making its first appearance at a ULI event during the 2018 Spring Meeting in Detroit, as it ramps up marketing to developers for its next-generation approach to modular home construction.\n\n\u201cThis is where construction is going,\u201d said Benji Miller, Kasita\u2019s chief operating officer, as he lounged in a Kasita prototype parked outside the Cobo Center. \u201cWe take a lot of the risk out of the process.\u201d\n\nThe Kasita unit is available for ULI Spring Meeting attendees to tour, providing a glimpse into how Kasita has reengineered a living environment, including a kitchen, washing machine, and bathroom with shower.\n\nKasita\u2019s units range from 352 to 408 square feet (33 to 38 sq m) and prices start at about $90,000. Two designs are available: the Independent, a stand-alone accessory dwelling unit, and Community, a \u201cmodular, stackable, high-density product for real estate developers, institutions, governments, and anyone who wants to place multiple units in tight urban spaces,\u201d according to company marketing materials.\n\nUnits priced at $109,000 are shipped fully equipped with appliances and furniture, including a queen-size bed that slides away to create more living space. Storage space is also available under the floor or in optional cabinets.\n\nEach unit is wired for an Alexa-like home assistant to control lights and appliances. Eleven-foot-high (3.4 m) ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, and elevated spaces are designed to give the units the look and feel of a larger space.\n\nWhile companies have been pitching modular concepts for decades, rising construction and labor costs make prefab more enticing for developers, the company says. \u201cWe think the time is right for this,\u201d said Dason Whitsett, the principal architect. Construction in a \u201ccontrolled factory environment is not subject to the whims of the market,\u201d he said.\n\nStandardized and tightly controlled manufacturing can eliminate many of the past problems that builders have experienced using modular designs, Miller says. No welding is required in the process of site prep, he says. \u201cWe have spent a lot of time looking at framing and production,\u201d Miller says.\n\nSome of Kasita\u2019s models come fully furnished with convertible furniture hooked up to Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice assistant system.\n\nWork is expected to begin later this year on a mixed-use, 24-unit project in Denver. The company also has a commitment for a project in New York, Miller says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hitting places that are being hit hard by the housing crisis and the lack of supply of housing,\u201d Matt McPheely, the company\u2019s head of sales, told the Denver Post. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a manufacturing approach to housing, which enables high precision and scalability.\u201d\n\nIn California, the company has been touting the use of the units for granny flats, but the company\u2019s focus is on larger projects. Four to five stories is the ideal height for projects, the executives say.\n\n\u201cThe assumption is we are a tiny home,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWe are really a modular builder.\u201d\n\nKasita founder Jeff Wilson famously spent a year living in a 33-square-foot (3 sq m) Dumpster \u201cto understand how people live in small spaces.\u201d",

The company is even working to develop interchangeable wall tiles so you can slot in tiles with shelving, bike racks, or storage instead of hammering into your walls.\n\nKasita will be available to preorder online starting April 5. The company hasn\u2019t revealed pricing yet, but said the mortgage will cost less than rent in cities like New York and San Francisco. There\u2019s an option to rent a Kasita instead of buy one.\n\nThe homes are also mobile, with a unique docking system that will let you take them wherever you want to move as long as the city you\u2019re relocating to also has Kasita docks.",

Units could also be used for student housing and other populations, executives said.\n\nDevelopers say units will \u201cfeel spacious and full of light\u201d equipped with traditional amenities such as a queen size bed, walk-in shower, refrigerator, convection oven and cooktop, dishwasher and laundry machines.\n\nEach Kasita will plug into traditional utilities.\n\nDevelopers say they\u2019ll eventually post prices to rent or buy Kasitas, but say that rents will be at half the market rate for a studio.\n\nWilson is teaming up with Kasita co-founder Taylor Wilson for the plan, which was announced at the South by Southwest Eco conference this week. The two Wilsons are not related.\n\nThe Kasitas will be available in Austin beginning in 2016 and in potentially ten other cities starting in 2017. Future Kasita homes could include Portland, Los Angeles, Brooklyn and Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nIn Austin, the project is slated for two different sites near downtown and in East Austin, Taylor Wilson said. However, a specific location has not been finalized, he added.\n\nTaylor Wilson announced a micro-unit concept project earlier this year. In March, Taylor Wilson announced a \u2018micro-unit\u2019 apartment project, Spire, for the East Austin area. However a site for that plan is still pending.\n\nEach unit was an estimated 400 square feet.",

        "text": "It's becoming more and more difficult to find affordable housing within urban areas of major cities, and Austin, TX is no exception.\n\nMillennials and many young professionals prefer to live in walkable neighborhoods close to where they work. Unfortunately, real estate in these areas is often not within budget, or there's simply no real estate to be found.\n\nHowever, a innovative new project aims to change that. A professor at the University of Texas, Austin, has developed a system for creating affordable housing using shipping containers. The units are designed to be energy-efficient and have all the amenities you'd expect from a modern home.\n\nThe first phase of the project is expected to feature 12 homes, ranging in size from 400 to 800 square feet. Each unit will have its own private entrance, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and living area. The homes will also be equipped with solar panels and rainwater harvesting systems, making them extremely energy-efficient.\n\nThe project's goal is not only to provide affordable housing but also to create a sense of community among residents. The units will be arranged in a way that encourages interaction between neighbors, with shared spaces for socializing and community events.\n\nThis innovative approach to affordable housing has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about housing in urban areas. By using shipping containers as building blocks, the project's creators are able to keep costs down while still providing high-quality homes with all the amenities residents need.\n\nThe project is currently seeking funding and permits before breaking ground on the first phase of construction. Once completed, the affordable housing units will be available for rent or purchase by low-income individuals and families who are struggling to find affordable options in the area.",

The modular homes can be slotted in and out of a pre-built building fitted with metal frameworks called \u2018racks\u2019, so moving is as easy as renting a flatbed truck to haul your home to a new location, provided it\u2019s in a city where Kasita is available.\n\nThe units come with all the comforts of a normal apartment: showers, a fully-equipped kitchen, a stow-away queen-size bed and a walk-in shower. Hookup valves, connected to municipal utilities, take care of water, sewage and electricity in each Kasita. And then there are the little things that make a house a home, like self-adjusting temperature, or hands-free commands for playing your favorite music and dimming the lights\u2026\n\nTargeting urban millennials, professionals and singles that have the freedom to jump from city to city, Kasita is gearing up to have their first building in Austin, Texas in 2016, and a unit is rumored to have monthly rent value of around $600 \u2013 about half the market rate, made possible by local partnerships. Targeted cities in 2017 include New York, Portland, Seattle, and Stockholm.\n\nKeep tabs on Kasita, they could be in your city next!",

        "text": "Professor Jeff Wilson wants to create the \u201ciPhone for housing\u201d. He thinks we need to shed our preconceptions of housing as dependent on land and instead consider his plug-and-play shelter.\n\nHis Kasita units are not just tiny homes- the prototype is 208 square feet-, but they fit onto a \u201crack\u201d to become part of \u201ca vertical, high-end, design-yet-affordable, urban trailer park\u201d. \u201cThink about an RV park\u201d, explains Wilson, \u201cit\u2019s a vertical way to do that: so you own your RV and you park it in a slot, this is a structure that these can go vertically.\u201d\n\nBorn into the zeitgeist of the Tiny House Movement, Kasita goes far beyond size with its housing-as-a-service. \u201cThe problem with tiny houses is the coding, the permitting and the land. And the land\u2019s the most difficult issue to solve because the folks who usually have the land are not the folks that need affordable housing. So our model allows the folks that have the land to highly monetize that land while providing home ownership to someone.\u201d\n\nThe Kasita is built according to international building code and the unit and rack structure is zoned as multi-unit housing. Kasita, according to Wilson, isn\u2019t a real estate firm, but a product company. They\u2019re not just selling their \u201ciPhones for housing\u201d, but they\u2019re selling the racks so anyone with a bit of land can create their own \u201cvertical, high-end, urban trailer park\u201d.\n\nIf Wilson and his team can sell enough racks around the country, these modular units could become truly mobile: the idea is, in the future, owners could request a move via an app on their phone.\n\n\u201cSo folks aren\u2019t going to be flying around all the time in their Kasitas, but in 5 years let\u2019s say you want to move your Kasita, we can pull you out of that rack, put you on an 18-wheeler truck and move you to another rack or put it in a backyard. So you\u2019re no longer bound to the land that you own your house on and we think that that\u2019s the way that the world is moving.\u201d\n\nWilson was inspired to attempt to revolutionize housing while, as a college professor, he tried living in a 33-square-foot dumpster for 10 months. In 2016 he built the prototype and later this year he plans to launch the 320-square-foot production model at 3 locations in Austin. There will be an option to rent or buy and while Wilson hasn\u2019t released the price, he says it will be affordable even to a barista.",

        "text": "AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--After three years of R&D, Austin-based housing startup KASITATM revealed its prototype at SXSW\u00ae Interactive, where it was awarded the 2016 SXSW Innovation Award in the Smart Cities category.\n\nNamed one of 2016\u2019s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company, KASITA is transforming urban living, designing and fabricating housing that is more affordable, adaptable and efficient than anything offered by the status quo.\n\nKASITA\u2019s futuristic metal and glass housing units measure approximately 300 square feet, catering to the increasing numbers of one and two person households in today\u2019s cities. Units are packed with amenities, smart home tech and custom furnishings that take advantage of every cubic inch of space. Because they are mass-produced, construction costs are kept low and quality high. KASITA units are quickly attached to a patent pending plug-and-play rack, which can be set up in days and quickly hooked up to utility lines.\n\nThe racks slide into underutilized or unused urban lots that are too small for conventional housing development. A KASITA development is being built in Austin later this year, and there is a great deal of interest from cities across the globe. At SXSW, 14 mayors visited the KASITA prototype, including those from San Jose, Providence and Kansas City, each evaluating KASITA as an affordable solution for their cities.\n\n\u201cUrban housing is perhaps the single most important factor in facing the economic, environmental and social challenges that face humanity today,\u201d said KASITA founder and CEO Jeff Wilson. He believes the status quo is failing, and failing bad. As the world\u2019s populations urbanize, urban cores are facing extreme housing shortages, driving up housing costs and driving out the middle class as well as artists, creatives, immigrants and young professionals who are the cultural capital that make cities great.\n\n\u201cEvery aspect of KASITA -- from its high tech prefabricated construction to its ability to set up quickly on discounted land -- was designed to create both an amazing living experience and produce development and living costs that crush traditional site building in terms of affordability,\u201d Wilson said.",

Become a free or sustaining member to read unlimited articles, webinars and ebooks.\nBECOME A MEMBER\n\nThere are plenty of apps designed to make moving easier, but a new kind of apartment takes tech-driven efficiency to a new level.\n\nMerging the concepts of micro-housing and on-demand services (as well as downsizing for more affordable living in expensive urban neighborhoods), a college professor designed Kasita, high-tech, compact living cubes that, modular style, can slide into and out of steel frames tucked into undeveloped spaces in urban cores.\n\nBefore coming up with Kasita, Jeff Wilson, an environmental science professor at the University of Texas at Austin, spent 10 months living in a converted Dumpster in an experiment with cutting down on possessions and tiny housing. He then worked with industrial design firm Frog to create a template for a 208-square-foot, single-occupancy city apartment.\n\nAccording to Fast Company:\n\nThe prefab buildings are also fully loaded with smart tech. You can tell the glass to darken if you want privacy, turn on the lights and music, or ask for the morning news. Though the first units will plug into the grid, the startup envisions eventually running them off solar power stored in Tesla batteries and adding features like rainwater collection.\n\nWhen they want to relocate, renters would press a button on an app that calls for a moving truck to slide the apartment out of the building and drive it to an empty slot in another. Wilson envisions Kasita frames existing in cities around the world. Units can be reconfigured and moved or replaced, depending on local building codes.\n\n(Credit: Kasita)\n\nHe also sees Kasita as part of the affordable housing solution. \u201cWe are very confident that these will rent for about half of market for a studio,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cSo in Austin, that is about $600.\u201d\n\nAustin is the first city set to get a Kasita building, likely next year.
