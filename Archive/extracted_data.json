        "Content": "Capbase product Set up a new company in 5 minutes with Capbase Blog As Professor Dumpster, Jeff has lived in a 33 sq. ft. modified trash dumpster as part of an environmental education and minimalist housing experiment. His work on sustainability and minimalism has been covered broadly by publications like Forbes, The Atlantic, NY Times, and The Washington Post. Jeff talked to us about his \u00e2\u0080\u009cDumpster Project\u00e2\u0080\u009d as well as his previous and current startup ventures. As an entrepreneur, Jeff has founded and built a micro housing startup, Kasita, that was sold off in 2018. Jeff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest company Jupe, has been a part of the recent Y Combinator batch, and Jeff also highlights what he learned from that experience. In our conversation with Jeff we also discuss the details of how his current product works, the challenges of building a hardware company, picking the right co-founder, and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 fundraising at the urinals.   Greg Miaskiewicz:  So, we'd like to talk about the very beginning stories on Startup Foundations. So how did you first become an entrepreneur? How did you get interested in big business startups, high-intensity interval capitalism? Jeff Wilson:  I like that term. Is there an acronym? Greg Miaskiewicz: It's HIIC. Jeff Wilson: HIIC. Well, I'm a sixth generation Texan. Greg Miaskiewicz: Natural born HIIC. Jeff Wilson:  So it's a weird story. I've been an environmental science professor, a tenured professor. Safest job in the world. I decided I wanted to do this experiment around minimal living and around waste. So I convinced the university administration, to let me live in a 33 square foot dumpster for a year. An actual used trash dumpster and convert into a home. When you have aspirations as a professor of being part of the 1%, it's probably going to have nothing to do with wealth.  So I just went with, I'll live in 1% the volume of the average American home, own 1% of the stuff and consume 1% of the energy and water.  So did this and began moving my little dumpster house around the city and playing with coding officials and planning and learning how to design small spaces. And at one point, as you're laying in your dumpster at night, looking up at the heavens through the roof, this idea came to me of making the iPhone of housing. An integrated piece of hardware and software. Of course, there's an iPhone at Tesla and Uber and everything I learned later. But it seemed like a good  enough idea. I moved out of the dumpster, raised my first check and started a company called Kasita.

        "Content": "Sign up for the free, 5-minute weekly email sharing the best tips, tools, and\n        ideas from inside our private founder community. \n          \"It's like finding money buried on your land.\" Jupe gives customers a high-tech dwelling and takes 30% of the revenue from bookings. Here's how they do it. \n         The world wants us to be vanilla. To put us into a box. And that's why when I come across original thinkers and characters like the founders of Jupe, I get hypnotized by their quirkiness.\u00a0 Today's interview is with Hampton member Antonio Gonzalez and his partner Jeff Wilson, the founders of Jupe.\u00a0 Their product is fascinating. They're high-tech tents that don't feel like tents (and don't call them a tent...they don't like that!). The company gives Jupes to customers with land for free and Jupe takes a 30% cut of rental revenue.\u00a0 Plus, before founding Jupe, Wilson lived in a dumpster to test different ideas (seriously).\u00a0 Jupe is on track to do $12 million in sales this year and has raised $9.5 million from people like Garry Tan\u00a0and Y-Combinator.\u00a0 Here's their story... *****  My name is Jeff Wilson, and along with my co-founder, Antonio (a Hampton member), we run Jupe. We make products that allow landowners to pop-up a nature hospitality site in a day, instantly activating and monetizing an underutilized asset.\u00a0 It's essentially like finding money buried on your land.\u00a0 Our main product is a bedroom that can drag and drop anywhere in nature \u2014 ready to rent in under two hours. We either sell the units or rev-share them with little to no capex required on the part of the landowner. We're on track to do $12 million in revenue this year. Our longer goal is to use our technology to enable the build of a pop-up, off-grid living experience anywhere on the planet, complete with caf\u00e9s, internet via Starlink, restaurants, and even saunas.\u00a0  This all started when I decided to live a year in a dumpster as a sort of tiny living experiment.\u00a0 Over the course of the year in the dumpster, I learned to design tiny spaces and saw the opportunity for micro-units, also known as ADUs (accessory dwelling units). I raised some money and launched Kasita, a tiny smart home that was stackable and, conceptually, movable. Ultimately, Kasita failed. I was left with $100,000 in credit card debt and became severely down on myself.I decided the best thing to do was to move to a small desert town in west Texas called Marfa \u2014 specifically into a non-air conditioned trailer (with a heart on it no less) and resolved to live my days out just working a bar out there, as a failure. But one day I saw a photo of EV automaker Rivian's Skateboard Chassis and thought - hmm - we could do that for housing. During my Kasita days, I did meet a guy named Antonio during the process and we later went on to found Jupe. Jupe is essentially a flat-packed bedroom that can be dragged and dropped into nature and popped up and ready to rent.\u00a0  I knew from my days at Kasita that it was extremely important to get a hardware product out into the hands of customers (even if it didn't meet code/zoning regs) so I told our first engineer that we would need to go from some designs on paper to someone actually sleeping in the unit in less than 60 days. The engineer didn't seem to have much of a problem with this, because Elon had instructed him to do the same with the first star hopper rocket in south Texas except Elon had only given him five weeks :-)   The thing was sorta a P.O.S. (as prototypes often are) but beautiful at the same time. We did manage to hit that deadline and even had the founder of Soylent stay in the prototype Jupe the very first night. The guy was used to experimenting on himself and dog food eating so he was perfect.  In the beginning, we had a lot of trouble figuring out what product market fit would be. We initially started with concerts, but given that the company's first pitches to investors were in March 20 20 the pandemic pretty much shut that go-to-market down. We then hard pivoted into Covid emergency shelters for hospitals, but it turned out that the hospitals didn't actually overflow, and even worse, there were no budgets at the hospitals to purchase or rent additional housing for emergency workers. We eventually stumbled in to the $5 billion market of outdoor hospitality and discovered that it was growing about 17% with no major players in the industry OD more than even in 5% of that business, so this is where we chose to spend our time and have found that there are some real legs and real growth opportunities in this market. In the summer of 2021, we were admitted and funded by Y Combinator and this really upped our game, allowed us to raise money from some of the best investors in Silicon Valley, and attract the talent to build this rocket ship into a real thing and get it in the orbit. The number one mantra that we have is to ship product and talk to customers. We also have found that continuing to pound on our bigger mission of solving problems around construction, off grid, living, sustainability, and general housing needs have helped us to stay motivated as a team and attract top people that want to work on these problems and not just another SaaS product or App. Our marketing spend has been almost 0, and myself and my co-founder. Antonio are the key salespeople we have found that telling our bigger story and the story of our founders has generated interest and bars that have allowed us to acquire customers at a very low cost. As we develop further products, that ship faster and in tighter packages, we intend to move in to some new markets. We expect to do around $12M in revenue this year (about 400 units deployed) along with several very large Jupe's nature resorts (50+ Jupes). A growth strategy is to continue to acquire the best pieces of land and partner with landowners and ideal locations, and also to create a few new products that will round out our early go to market strategy as a denature hospitality provider of product. Our longer aim is to create what we call \"universal autonomous housing\" which is a very long word for popping up a village, anywhere on the face of the planet, and then moving that village very efficiently in a fleet-style fashion. We are looking to capture the future of humanity, and how folks want to live work, and play given movements towards remote work and climate change.\u00a0 The name of the game in hard tech start-ups is survival. Even Elon took over 15 years to really find his stride at both Tesla and SpaceX. And these are now two of the largest most innovative, most impactful companies on the planet. We know that this is a long and a very hard game to play so we've had to make hard decisions along the way. For example, in February 2021 the company had two weeks of cash and was considering shutting down, paying back deposits to customers, and paying severance to the employees that would be laid off. I had to make the hard decision to lay off the entire team besides myself, my co-founder, and one engineer and almost miraculously manage to find the cash from some angel investors, and then close more business than we had in the history of the company. And just those two weeks later we got into Y Combinator and were able to really get the fly wheel spinning at the company.  I think the biggest thing that we've learned is leaning into survival instinct, which sometimes means fight, and sometimes means flight. Keeping a very close eye on burn, cash in bank, and whether we are default alive, or default dead (great peace by Y Combinator, founder of Paul Graham). We're actually quite obsessive on our platforms. Here's a notion Page link to all 51 if you're interested. My personal favorites are Airtable for DB management and Notion for overall org and notes management (now with an epic AI integration).\u00a0 What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources? Go for it and get started! You never know the right timing for an idea to really take off but if you don't start now, you can't go back to win the time might've been right. Launch early, launch often, and then listen to users and improve the product. It's better to go down in flames than to softly go out in a whimper. If you fail, don't go get a 'normal' job - go at it again.\u00a0  Jupe is always looking to hire folks into the mission and looking to get people deeper into nature and ultimately solve major housing issues. Have a look at our manifesto and vision page and reach out if anything looks interesting or if you have ideas that you think you should potentially explore. Personally, I find being the CEO of a startup to be downright exhilarating. But, as I'm sure you well know, it can also be a bit lonely and stressful at times, too. Because, let's be honest, if you're the kind of person with the guts to actually launch and run a startup, then you can bet everyone will always be asking you a thousand questions, expecting you to have all the right answers -- all the time. And that's okay! Navigating this kind of pressure is the job. But what about all the difficult questions that you have as you reach each new level of growth and success? For tax questions, you have an accountant. For legal, your attorney. And for tech. your dev team. This is where Hampton comes in.
